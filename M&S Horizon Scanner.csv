Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive,Monitor,ESG,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The Directive will introduce a sustainability due diligence duty on large EU companies and non-EU companies with significant EU activity to address adverse human rights and environmental impacts in their own operations, their subsidiaries and their value chains. For in-scope entities, the proposal includes:
<br>
The Directive will apply to the following: <p><p>
1. EU companies that have more than 500 employees and a net worldwide turnover of €150 million. <p>
2. Non-EU companies if they have €300 million of net turnover generated in the EU. The Directive will apply to these non-EU companies three years after the Directive enters into force. The European Commission will be required to publish a list of non-EU companies that come within the scope of the Directive. <p>
3.  EU companies with over 250 employees and turnover exceeding €40 million if at least €20 million is generated in a sector that is designated as high risk. <p> 
4.  non-EU companies and parent companies with equivalent turnover in the European Union. <p>
The financial sector (for example, banks, insurance companies and asset managers) will have a limited due diligence obligation, limited to their own operations and supply chains. However, there will be a review clause for potential full inclusion of this sector based on an impact assessment.
<br>
Broadly, the Directive will require due diligence regarding actual and potential adverse impacts on the environment and human rights. In addition, large EU companies will be obligated to adopt a climate transition plan in line with the Paris Agreement.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
If these thresholds are met, we advise M&S to conduct an early impact assessment of its internal policies, to determine whether any revisions would be necessary to ensure it can meet the standards imposed by the due diligence duty.

Economic Corporate Crime & Transparency Act 2023,Monitor,Compliance,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The Act received Royal Assent on 26 October 2023. Key provisions include:
<br>
- Senior manager attribution liability. Provisions are contained in the Act which will make it possible to hold a business criminally liable for the criminal conduct of their senior managers in respect of economic crime offences from 26 December 2023.
<br>
- A new corporate criminal offence of failing to prevent fraud. This applies only to large organisations or parent groups which are large organisations. It is a strict liability, negligence-based offence of failing to prevent fraud-type offences being committed by associates, with a defence of adequate procedures in place to prevent fraud.
<br>
The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (Commencement No. 1) Regulations 2023, SI 1206/2023 were published on 13 November 2023 and bring into force provisions in the Act dealing with e.g. SFO pre investigation powers and disclosures to prevent, detect or investigate economic crime.
<br>
New exemptions for the regulated sector 
The Act sets out two exemptions from the principal money laundering offences under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002:
• allowing firms to return money to a customer as part of exiting a relationship, where the amount is less than the minimum (£1000)
• allowing firms to enable their customers to transact on their accounts even where they know or suspect that a part of the funds in the account is criminal property, where they have put systems in place to ringfence the tainted portion from the untainted portion
<br>
<br>
Information sharing
<br>
The Act introduces changes regarding information collection and sharing, in the context of financial crime investigations:
• new powers enable businesses to share information for the purposes of preventing, investigating or detecting economic crime more easily, by disapplying civil liability for breaches of confidentiality in certain situations 
• the NCA is given the power to proactively intelligence gather by adapting the existing 'further information orders' regime by removing the requirement for a pre-existing Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) to have been submitted before an Information Order (IO) can be made and by extending the regime to terrorist financing investigations.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
M&S will be able to avoid prosecution if it can prove it has established reasonable procedures to prevent fraud. 

The government published a factsheet on 26 October 2023, setting out what is considered as reasonable fraud prevention procedures, which need to considered while reviewing existing policies, procedures, systems, processes and anti-fraud controls.

"Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill",Prepare,Digital,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The long-awaited Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill (Bill) was introduced to Parliament on 25 April 2023.  While the upfront regulation of digital markets has been the main headline, some fundamental changes are afoot in the consumer protection sphere, combined with enhanced powers to investigate companies that breach competition law. 
<br>
Importantly, the Bill: 
• introduces direct enforcement powers for the CMA to be able to investigate undertakings for breaches of consumer law and to impose fines of up to 10% of worldwide turnover for breaches as well as fines of up to £300,000 on individuals. This is similar to the CMA's powers in competition law cases and enforcement is expected to follow similar procedures. The CMA has a range of investigatory powers backed by penalties for failure to co-operate or providing false or misleading information. 
• sets up a new regulatory regime for 'big tech' – this will  be of interest to clients operating online particularly via key digital platforms and those who rely on digital operators for their marketing efforts to reach customers; and
• provides a bolstered suite of powers for the CMA in the merger control and competition enforcement spheres which include the streamlining of certain procedures and better information gathering reach.
<br>
The Bill is expected to achieve broad support and pass quickly. The Bill has completed its Second Reading in the House of Lords and its committee stage is expected to start in 22 January 2024.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
</p>"
Enforcement focus on digital markets,Prepare,Digital,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The new digital powers included within the Digital Markets Competition and Consumer Bill (DMCC) will enable the CMA's Digital Markets Unit to impose rules on certain individual companies. The new rules will only apply to very large businesses with global turnover exceeding £25bn, or UK turnover exceeding £1bn.  Above these thresholds, companies will be caught if they are engaged in ""digital activities linked to the UK""; a broad term that captures the provision of services using the internet as well as the provision of digital content.

The UK regime is set to broadly align with the existing EU Digital Markets Act, with the notable difference that the CMA can tailor codes of practice to individual designated companies (""gatekeepers""), whereas the EU regime sets out a set of general rules for gatekeepers to follow.

Alongside these regulatory reforms, competition authorities have been targeting digital markets with market reviews and enforcement investigations. 

The CMA will continue reviewing public cloud infrastructure services as well as mobile browsers and cloud gaming services throughout 2024, with final reports and potential remedies expected in 2025. The FCA plans to publish its conclusions on wholesale financial data market study in March 2024.

As to enforcement activities in digital markets, the CMA will be progressing its Apple AppStore, Google Play and Google Ad Tech investigations throughout 2024.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
The DMCC Bill sets up a new regulatory regime for 'big tech'. It this will be of interest to M&S if it operates online particularly via key digital platforms and those who rely on digital operators for their marketing efforts to reach customers. Individual companies should be designated under the regulatory regime and made subject to codes of practice from mid-2025 onwards.  

Competition authorities' market investigations and broader enforcement work could also present future opportunities for R&C clients, should they decide to impose remedies to encourage healthier competition between providers of digital services.

Review of retained EU law,Monitor,Compliance,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
Since Brexit, the UK Government has sought to identify areas of potential regulatory reform. To facilitate this, the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act: 
• removed the concept of supremacy of retained EU law over UK law; 
• earmarked for revocation EU-derived rights, general principles of EU law and around 600 legislative instruments originating from the EU; and 
• outlined a process for the Government to continue its review of retained EU law and propose further legislative changes. 

The Government's review exercise will span several years. By December 2023, the Government had launched consultations proposing to reform regulations relating to:
• employment law; 
• the wine sector; and 
• product safety.
The Government must publish progress reports to Parliament every 6 months from January 2024 onwards.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
The legislative review may lead to positive developments and offer pockets of opportunity for UK-centric businesses.

In the mid to longer term, UK law is likely to gradually veer away from EU law, which will make compliance more complex for clients with a cross-border footprint. 

We encourage M&S to keep a watching brief of the progressive removal of retained EU law from the UK statute books, to identify risks or opportunities for its business.

ICO consultation on draft biometric data guidance,Monitor,Digital,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The ICO has published the first phase of its draft guidance on biometric data and biometric technologies, which covers biometric data. The second phase will cover biometric classification and data protection and will include a call for evidence early next year. The consultation on the draft guidance closed on 20 October. The key points covered by the guidance are:
<br>
• What is biometric data?
• What is special category biometric data? The ICO states that this refers to using biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying (recognising) someone.
• What about other special category data? Not all biometric data is “special category biometric data.” This is only if you use it to uniquely identify someone. Even if this is not your purpose, the biometric data you process may still include other types of special category data.
• What is ""biometric recognition""? The ICO states that it uses the term “biometric recognition” to refer to biometric data used for identification and verification.
<br>
• Data protection requirements:
o It is likely that a biometric recognition system will result in a high risk to people's rights and freedoms, triggering the requirement to conduct a DPIA.
o You are using special category biometric data, explicit consent is likely to be the only valid condition. You must offer a suitable alternative to people who choose not to consent and ensure they do not feel under pressure to consent.
o You must adopt a privacy by design approach and consider whether you can deploy privacy enhancing technologies (PETs).
o Consider the risks of accuracy, discrimination and security.
o Consider the use of encryption to mitigate the security risk.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>The draft guidance does not change the law, but provides guidance on how to comply with the existing law.

If M&S is collecting and using biometric data, e.g., voice recognition for security purposes, it needs to ensure compliance with the existing data protection law. 

The draft guidance will assist it to identify the issues and how to address them, but M&S may wish to seek external advice, as this is a complex area.
</p>"
Environmental sustainability agreements,Monitor,ESG,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The CMA has made a public commitment to promote environmental sustainability to help transition to a net zero economy. It published guidance in October 2023 on the application of the Chapter I prohibition in the Competition Act 1998 to environmental sustainability agreements between firms operating at the same level of the supply chain. 

Under this framework the CMA operates an open door policy and provides informal advice to ensure competition law does not stand in the way of genuine efforts to tackle climate change.

The CMA published its first summary of informal advice in November 2023 in relation to Fairtrade’s planned Shared Impact Initiative for the sourcing of Fairtrade banana, coffee and cocoa products by participating UK grocery retailers. The stated objective of this initiative is to use longer-term supply arrangements to provide producers with the security they need to invest in sustainable practices, including farming practices which reduce the environmental impact of production. The CMA has indicated the agreement is unlikely to raise competition concerns.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
To the extent M&S is looking to partner with other industry operators to drive environmental sustainability, the October 2023 guidance and the CMA's open door policy are helpful developments which will provide much-needed clarifications and facilitate co-operative efforts in this area.

Digitising UK shares,Monitor,Digital,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The UK Digitisation Taskforce was established in July 2022 under Sir Douglas Flint's lead. 

On 10 July 2023, the Taskforce published an interim report, which produced seven recommendations:
1. Legislation and company articles should be amended to stop the issuing of new paper share certificates. 
2. The government should introduce legislation to require dematerialisation of share certificates. 
3. The government should consult on approach to residual share paper interests and whether a time limit should be imposed on identifying untraced ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs). 
4. Intermediaries should have an obligation to implement technology that will enable them to response to UBO requests for issuers quickly. 
5. Intermediaries should be transparent about whether and the extent to which clients can access their rights as shareholders. 
6. Where intermediaries offer access to shareholder rights, the baseline service should facilitate the ability to vote, with confirmation that the vote has been recorded etc. 
7. Post digitation, the industry should discontinue cheque payments and mandate as a default, direct payment to UBO's nominated bank account. 

It is also suggested that changes to the Companies Act 2006, the Model Articles and FCA rules will be required implement some of these recommendations. 

Sir Douglas will be conducting a period of open engagement over the next six months, before delivering a final report to the government. The deadline for feedback is 25 September 2023.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
If legislated, a number of these reforms will be implemented and importantly, this will trigger an end to the right of companies to issue paper share certificates, which will impact how a shareholder will evidence title to shares in a UK company.

Increase to normal minimum pension age,Plan,Employment,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<p>
""Normal minimum pension age"" is the earliest age at which members are normally permitted to receive benefits from a registered pension scheme.  
<p>
<br>
From 6 April 2028, normal minimum pension age is due to increase from 55 to 57 (subject to transitional provisions for individuals with a pre-existing unqualified right to receive benefits before age 57).
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
This measure may impact the age at which members of the workforce take early retirement. It does not affect individuals meeting the statutory criteria for ill-health retirement.
</p>"
Restriction of multibuy deals of HFSS products,Plan,Compliance,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
From October 2025, new rules will be introduced banning multibuy deals on foods high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS). This includes ""buy one get one free"", ""three for two"" deals and restrictions on free refills for soft drinks.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
The rules only apply to selected categories of products and M&S should ascertain whether the restrictions apply to any of its products. 
<br>
It should consider: 
<br>
1. The scope of advertising campaigns.
<p>
2. Factual claims being made.
<p>
3. Additional enforcement measures they could be subject to, such as the imposition of civil fines and whether certain exemptions for online sales apply.
</p>"
Workers Act 2023,Prepare,Employment,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The Workers (Predictable Terms and Conditions) Act 2023 will give workers and agency workers the right to request a predictable work pattern where there is a lack of predictability as regards any part of their work pattern, the change relates to their work pattern and where the purpose in applying for the change is to get a more predictable work pattern. Fixed term contracts of 12 months or less are presumed to lack predictability. 
<p>
<br>
The Act allows for two applications in a twelve-month period with a minimum service requirement (expected to be 26 weeks) to access the right. Employers can reject applications on statutory grounds and workers will have the right not to suffer a detriment short of dismissal for making an application/automatic unfair dismissal right. 
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
M&S will need to assess the impact the new legislation will have on its business, as it could mean changes to the way work patterns are managed.  
</p>"
Employment Relations Act 2023,Prepare,Employment,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The Employment Relations (Flexible Working) Act 2023 will introduce changes to the right to request flexible working, including a new requirement that employers cannot refuse an application unless they have first consulted the employee about the application.  It allows for two statutory requests in any 12-month period (currently one), employers will be required to respond to a request within two months (currently three) and employees will no longer be required to explain what effect, if any, the change applied for will have on the employer and how the effect might be dealt with.  

Regulations will make flexible working requests a day one right, removing the current 26-week qualifying period and will come into force on 6 April 2024. There is currently no commencement date for the other provisions, but ACAS has indicated that it expects the additional reforms to come into force at the same time as the day one right to request flexible working on 6 April 2024.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
M&S needs to be aware of the new measures coming through, in particular, the removal of the 26-week qualifying period for making flexible working requests from 6 April 2024.
<br>
It will also need to update policies and train appropriate staff on the other changes before April 2024
</p>"
New National Living and Minimum wage,Prepare,Employment,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
From 1 April 2024 the National Living Wage (NLW) will apply to all workers aged 21 and over and will rise from £10.42 to £11.44 per hour. 
<br>
National Minimum Wage (NMW) rates will also rise: 
<p>
• from £7.49 to £8.60 for those aged 18-20, 
<p>
• from £5.28 to £6.40 for those aged 16-17; and 
<p>
• from £5.28 to £6.40 for Apprentices. 
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
The almost 10% increase in the NLW up to £11.44/hour will apply to 21-year-olds for the first time and will mean that the minimum salary of a worker working 40 hours per week will be near £24,000. 
<p>
<br>
M&S will face higher wages bills, most likely including the knock-on effect of higher wages for more senior employees to maintain an appropriate pay differential. The increase will also bring more workers closer to the NLW / NMW limits. 
<p>
<br>
M&S will need to be alive to the common risk areas that create NLW / NMW underpayment, especially within the context of different job roles or sections of the workforce that were not perhaps previously in scope of the NLW / NMW legislation.
</p>"
Paternity leave reforms,Monitor,Employment,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The Government has set out changes to paternity leave to be implemented.  Eligible fathers and partners will be able to take paid paternity leave in two separate blocks of one week each if they wish rather than having to take all their leave in one go at any time within the first 52 weeks of birth (or placement for adoption) rather than in the first 8 weeks of birth (or placement for adoption). 
<p>
<p>
Fathers and partners will need to give their notice of entitlement to paternity leave and pay 15 weeks before the birth, but for notice of the paternity leave start date they will only need to give 28 days' notice before the date that they intend to take each period of leave (and pay, where they qualify). 
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
M&S will need to update policies on paternity leave when the proposals are implemented.
</p>"
Duty to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace,Prepare,Employment,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
Under the Worker Protection (Amendment of Equality Act 2010) Act 2023, employers will be under a new mandatory duty to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment of their employees in the course of their employment. Breach of this duty may be enforced by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) under its existing enforcement powers and, where a claim for sexual harassment has been upheld, by an employment tribunal.
<p>
<br>
 The tribunal may order an uplift of up to 25% of any compensation awarded for sexual harassment if the tribunal considers that the duty to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment has been breached.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
M&S will be required to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment and should train line managers on the new duty before October 2024.
</p>"
"Statutory Code on ""Fire and Rehire""",Monitor,Employment,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The Government published a draft Code of Practice on the use of dismissal and re-engagement practices to bring about changes to employees' terms and conditions of employment along with a consultation inviting views on the draft Code in January 2023.  
<p>
<br>
The draft Code sets out a step-by-step process that an employer should follow to explore alternatives to dismissal and to engage in meaningful consultation with trade unions, employee representatives or with affected employees to find an agreed solution.  
<p>
<br>
Tribunals and courts will be required to take into account the statutory code when considering relevant cases with the power to uplift an employee's compensation by 25% where the code applies and the employer has unreasonably failed to follow it.

The Employment Rights Regulations 2023,Action,Employment,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The Employment Rights (Amendment, Revocation and Transitional Provision) 
Regulations 2023 came into force on 1 January 2024 and amend the Working Time Regulations and TUPE, following consultations earlier in 2023. 
<p>
<br>
• Time record keeping: 
<p>
The Regulations simplify record-keeping requirements under WTR to provide that employers do not have to keep a record of the daily working hours of all workers, if they are able to demonstrate compliance without doing so. 
<p>
<br>
• Single annual leave entitlement: 
<p>
They maintain two distinct pots of annual leave and two existing rates of holiday pay, so that workers continue to receive 4 weeks at normal rate of pay and 1.6 weeks at basic rate of pay.  They also define normal remuneration to retain the two rates of pay, so that a week's pay for the purposes of holiday pay for the 4 weeks at the normal pay rate includes, among other things, commission and regular overtime. 
<p>
<br>
• Irregular-hours/part-year workers: 
<p>
They permit rolled-up holiday pay for irregular-hours and part-year workers only. The Government will legislate to ensure that all employers that choose to use rolled-up holiday pay calculate it based on a worker's total earnings in a pay period. 
They provide a method for calculating holiday accrual for irregular-hours and part-year workers, which may include some agency workers, based on 12.07% of hours worked in a pay period both in the first year of employment and beyond. Other workers continue to accrue leave at 1/12th of their entitlement on the first day of each month during their first year of employment. 
They define irregular-hours and part-year workers and introduce a 52-week reference period for accrued annual leave, when irregular-hours and part-year workers go on maternity/family related leave or sick leave, allowing employers to look back and work out an average of hours worked across that period. 
<p>
<br>
• Preserving rights derived from EU case law: 
<p>
They preserve workers' existing rights derived from EU case law to carry over untaken holiday into the following leave year in certain situations, including, among other things, inability to take holiday due to sickness, maternity/family related leave or where misclassified or dissuaded from taking it. 
<p>
<br>
• Repealing COVID-19 holiday rules: 
<p>
They repeal the COVID-19 holiday carry-over rules, with a short transitional period to enable any accrued leave to be used up. 
<p>
<br>
• TUPE Reforms: 
<p>
They amend TUPE to allow small businesses (less than 50 employees) that propose a transfer of any size, along with businesses of any size that propose to transfer fewer than 10 employees, to consult directly with their employees if there are no existing worker representatives in place.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
M&S will need to analyse who will be caught by the new definition of irregular hours and part year workers.  The changes to irregular hours and part year workers will apply in the holiday year beginning on or after 1 April 2024.
<p>
<br>
If M&S wants to use rolled up holiday pay for its irregular hours and part year workers it will need to change their contracts.
<p>
<br>
M&S will also need to decide how to handle requests from irregular hours and part year workers to take more holiday than has been accrued at any given point in the year, as well as how these workers will be able to take their holiday that only accrues on the last day of the 12th period of the holiday year.
<p>
<br>
M&S will need to review contracts, policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the new rules, in particular, the capturing of overtime, commission and allowance payments in at least 4 weeks of holiday pay.
<p>
<br>
Employers will also need to tTake proactive steps to remind workers to use their holiday entitlement and ensure they have sufficient opportunity to take it.
