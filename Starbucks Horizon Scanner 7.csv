Economic Corporate Crime & Transparency Act 2023,Action,Risk & Compliance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The Act received Royal Assent on 26 October 2023. Key provisions include:
<br><br>
• Senior manager attribution liability. Provisions are contained in the Act which will make it possible to hold a business criminally liable for the criminal conduct of their senior managers in respect of economic crime offences from 26 December 2023.
<br><br>
• A new corporate criminal offence of failing to prevent fraud. This applies only to large organisations or parent groups which are large organisations. It is a strict liability, negligence-based offence of failing to prevent fraud-type offences being committed by associates, with a defence of adequate procedures in place to prevent fraud.
<br><br>
The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (Commencement No. 1) Regulations 2023, SI 1206/2023 were published on 13 November 2023 and bring into force provisions in the Act dealing with e.g. SFO pre investigation powers and disclosures to prevent, detect or investigate economic crime.
<br><br>
New exemptions for the regulated sector <br><br>
The Act sets out two exemptions from the principal money laundering offences under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002:
• allowing firms to return money to a customer as part of exiting a relationship, where the amount is less than the minimum (£1000)<br><br>
• allowing firms to enable their customers to transact on their accounts even where they know or suspect that a part of the funds in the account is criminal property, where they have put systems in place to ringfence the tainted portion from the untainted portion<br><br>

Information sharing<br><br>

The Act introduces changes regarding information collection and sharing, in the context of financial crime investigations:<br><br>
• new powers enable businesses to share information for the purposes of preventing, investigating or detecting economic crime more easily, by disapplying civil liability for breaches of confidentiality in certain situations <br><br>
• the NCA is given the power to proactively intelligence gather by adapting the existing 'further information orders' regime by removing the requirement for a pre-existing Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) to have been submitted before an Information Order (IO) can be made and by extending the regime to terrorist financing investigations<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
Starbucks will be able to avoid prosecution if it can prove it has established reasonable procedures to prevent fraud. 
<br><br>
The government published a factsheet on 26 October 2023, setting out what is considered as reasonable fraud prevention procedures, which need to considered while reviewing existing policies, procedures, systems, processes and anti-fraud controls.

Review of retained EU law,Monitor,Risk & Compliance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
Since Brexit, the UK Government has sought to identify areas of potential regulatory reform. To facilitate this, the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act: <br><br>
• removed the concept of supremacy of retained EU law over UK law; <br>
• earmarked for revocation EU-derived rights, general principles of EU law and around 600 legislative instruments originating from the EU; and <br>
• outlined a process for the Government to continue its review of retained EU law and propose further legislative changes. <br>
<br>
The Government's review exercise will span several years. By December 2023, the Government had launched consultations proposing to reform regulations relating to: <br>
• employment law; <br>
• the wine sector; and <br>
• product safety. <br><br>
The Government must publish progress reports to Parliament every 6 months from January 2024 onwards.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
The legislative review may lead to positive developments and offer pockets of opportunity for UK-centric businesses.
<br><br>
In the mid to longer term, UK law is likely to gradually veer away from EU law, which will make compliance more complex for clients with a cross-border footprint. 
<br><br>
We encourage Starbucks to keep a watching brief of the progressive removal of retained EU law from the UK statute books, to identify risks or opportunities for its business.

Omnibus Directive,Monitor,Risk & Compliance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The Omnibus Directive enhanced provisions for the protection of consumer rights, including by preventing the marketing of products as identical in different Member States when they actually have a significantly different composition or characteristics (known as ""dual quality marketing""). 
<br><br>
In assessing whether a product falls foul of the dual-quality marketing rules, the competent authority will take into account:
<br><br>
(i) whether the difference is easily identified by the consumer; and <br>

(ii) whether there are any legitimate and objective factors for differentiation, (eg. national law or availability of raw materials).  <br>
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
These rules apply to goods only, with a particular focus on food products. Breaches of the Omnibus Directive have large potential fines, up to 4% of a company's annual turnover in the Member State(s) in question, or €2 million if turnover cannot be determined.
<br><br>
As the rules have only been brought into national legislation recently, there are currently limited examples of where regulators have sought enforcement action against companies. One example is in Romania, where regulator investigations found that Fanta products had varying amounts of orange juice between Member States.
<br><br>
There is currently EU-level coordinated action to investigate before a decision is made regarding penalties. In addition, the combination of ambiguity in the current guidance and the lack of a European reference standard make breaches difficult to prove.

Restriction of multibuy deals of HFSS products,Plan,Risk & Compliance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
From October 2025, new rules will be introduced banning multibuy deals on foods high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS). This includes ""buy one get one free"", ""three for two"" deals and restrictions on free refills for soft drinks.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>
The rules only apply to selected categories of products and Starbucks should ascertain whether the restrictions apply to any of its products. <br><br>
It should consider: 
<br>
1. The scope of advertising campaigns.<br>
2. Factual claims being made.<br>
3. Additional enforcement measures they could be subject to, such as the imposition of civil fines and whether certain exemptions for online sales apply.

<p>
The Employment Rights (Amendment, Revocation and Transitional Provision) 
Regulations 2023 came into force on 1 January 2024 and amend the Working Time Regulations and TUPE, following consultations earlier in 2023. 
<p>
<br>
â€¢ Time record keeping: 
<p>
The Regulations simplify record-keeping requirements under WTR to provide that employers do not have to keep a record of the daily working hours of all workers, if they are able to demonstrate compliance without doing so. 
<p>
<br>
â€¢ Single annual leave entitlement: 
<p>
They maintain two distinct pots of annual leave and two existing rates of holiday pay, so that workers continue to receive 4 weeks at normal rate of pay and 1.6 weeks at basic rate of pay.  They also define normal remuneration to retain the two rates of pay, so that a week's pay for the purposes of holiday pay for the 4 weeks at the normal pay rate includes, among other things, commission and regular overtime. 
<p>
<br>
â€¢ Irregular-hours/part-year workers: 
<p>
They permit rolled-up holiday pay for irregular-hours and part-year workers only. The Government will legislate to ensure that all employers that choose to use rolled-up holiday pay calculate it based on a worker's total earnings in a pay period. 
They provide a method for calculating holiday accrual for irregular-hours and part-year workers, which may include some agency workers, based on 12.07% of hours worked in a pay period both in the first year of employment and beyond. Other workers continue to accrue leave at 1/12th of their entitlement on the first day of each month during their first year of employment. 
They define irregular-hours and part-year workers and introduce a 52-week reference period for accrued annual leave, when irregular-hours and part-year workers go on maternity/family related leave or sick leave, allowing employers to look back and work out an average of hours worked across that period. 
<p>
<br>
â€¢ Preserving rights derived from EU case law: 
<p>
They preserve workers' existing rights derived from EU case law to carry over untaken holiday into the following leave year in certain situations, including, among other things, inability to take holiday due to sickness, maternity/family related leave or where misclassified or dissuaded from taking it. 
<p>
<br>
â€¢ Repealing COVID-19 holiday rules: 
<p>
They repeal the COVID-19 holiday carry-over rules, with a short transitional period to enable any accrued leave to be used up. 
<p>
<br>
â€¢ TUPE Reforms: 
<p>
They amend TUPE to allow small businesses (less than 50 employees) that propose a transfer of any size, along with businesses of any size that propose to transfer fewer than 10 employees, to consult directly with their employees if there are no existing worker representatives in place.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
Starbucks will need to analyse who will be caught by the new definition of irregular hours and part year workers.  The changes to irregular hours and part year workers will apply in the holiday year beginning on or after 1 April 2024.
<p>
<br>
If Starbucks wants to use rolled up holiday pay for its irregular hours and part year workers it will need to change their contracts.
<p>
<br>
Starbucks will also need to decide how to handle requests from irregular hours and part year workers to take more holiday than has been accrued at any given point in the year, as well as how these workers will be able to take their holiday that only accrues on the last day of the 12th period of the holiday year.
<p>
<br>
Starbucks will need to review contracts, policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the new rules, in particular, the capturing of overtime, commission and allowance payments in at least 4 weeks of holiday pay.
<p>
<br>
Employers will also need to take proactive steps to remind workers to use their holiday entitlement and ensure they have sufficient opportunity to take it.

Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules,Monitor,Supply chain,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The Workers (Predictable Terms and Conditions) Act 2023 will give workers and agency workers the right to request a predictable work pattern where there is a lack of predictability as regards any part of their work pattern, the change relates to their work pattern and where the purpose in applying for the change is to get a more predictable work pattern. Fixed term contracts of 12 months or less are presumed to lack predictability. 
<BR><BR>
The Act allows for two applications in a twelve-month period with a minimum service requirement (expected to be 26 weeks) to access the right. Employers can reject applications on statutory grounds and workers will have the right not to suffer a detriment short of dismissal for making an application/automatic unfair dismissal right. 
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<BR>
Starbucks will need to assess the impact the new legislation will have on its business, as it could mean changes to the way work patterns are managed.  
</p>"
Expansion of Fixed Recoverable Costs,Monitor,Supply chain,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The Employment Relations (Flexible Working) Act 2023 will introduce changes to the right to request flexible working, including a new requirement that employers cannot refuse an application unless they have first consulted the employee about the application.  It allows for two statutory requests in any 12-month period (currently one), employers will be required to respond to a request within two months (currently three) and employees will no longer be required to explain what effect, if any, the change applied for will have on the employer and how the effect might be dealt with.  

Regulations will make flexible working requests a day one right, removing the current 26-week qualifying period and will come into force on 6 April 2024. There is currently no commencement date for the other provisions, but ACAS has indicated that it expects the additional reforms to come into force at the same time as the day one right to request flexible working on 6 April 2024.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
Starbucks needs to be aware of the new measures coming through, in particular, the removal of the 26-week qualifying period for making flexible working requests from 6 April 2024.
<br>
It will also need to update policies and train appropriate staff on the other changes before April 2024

R&D Reliefs Merging,Prepare,Supply chain,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
From 1 April 2024 the National Living Wage (NLW) will apply to all workers aged 21 and over and will rise from Â£10.42 to Â£11.44 per hour. 
<br>
National Minimum Wage (NMW) rates will also rise: 
<p>
â€¢ from Â£7.49 to Â£8.60 for those aged 18-20, 
<p>
â€¢ from Â£5.28 to Â£6.40 for those aged 16-17; and 
<p>
â€¢ from Â£5.28 to Â£6.40 for Apprentices. 
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
The almost 10% increase in the NLW up to Â£11.44/hour will apply to 21-year-olds for the first time and will mean that the minimum salary of a worker working 40 hours per week will be near Â£24,000. 
<p>
<br>
Starbucks will face higher wages bills, most likely including the knock-on effect of higher wages for more senior employees to maintain an appropriate pay differential. The increase will also bring more workers closer to the NLW / NMW limits. 
<p>
<br>
Starbucks will need to be alive to the common risk areas that create NLW / NMW underpayment, especially within the context of different job roles or sections of the workforce that were not perhaps previously in scope of the NLW / NMW legislation.
