Building Safety Bill,Prepare,Compliance,TRUE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>The big ticket stuff in RE in will be the introduction of the post-Grenfell changes contained in the Fire Safety Act 2021 (FSA) and Building Safety Bill (BSB) which will essentially implement the recommendations of the Hackitt Report. Intending to clarify the scope of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, the FSA received Royal Assent and was passed into law on 29 April 2021.</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>Although the FSA applies to ""domestic premises"", we consider that the broad duties in the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 still apply and that the FSA sets out a best practice approach to the management of risk in high risk
premises. The external facade of a building (including cladding, windows and balconies) should now be included in a fire risk assessment, along with doors opening to the common parts of the buildings. Fire risk assessments should therefore be reviewed and revised as soon as possible. Buildings, starting with high-rise multi-occupation, are to e ectively have a ""safety passport"" which follows them from construction through into the occupation phase, including maintenance and refurbishment, and ties into a revamped building regulations regime. Those involved in construction and management of buildings will have strict legal duties to reduce and manage building risk, complementing existing duties under the CDM and fire safety regimes, together with a digital ""golden thread"" ensuring accessibility to key design information relating to a building's safety throughout its lifetime. The reformed regime will aim to join up everything that until now has sat separately - building regs, fire safety obligations, planning and ongoing duties of care under health and safety legislation. There will be a new regulatory body in the form of the Building Safety Regulator, which sits within the Health and Safety Executive and will be up and running within 12 to 18 months but note it is already operating in shadow form. We can share knowledge pieces we have prepared already once you need them but we encourage familiarity with the changes to law as industry will need to making its preparations before the BSB (laid before Parliament on 5 July 2021), comes into force in 2023."

<br>
The real estate sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gases and major consumer of non-renewable energy sources. Globally, there continues to be a perception that the real estate sector lags behind other sectors in its response to environmental challenges, despite a growing number of diverse environmental standards at a building, portfolio, company ESG and Government policy level. The Environment Bill (due to be passed Autumn/Winter 2021 after amendment
to facilitate reduction to sewage discharges from storm overflows) along with introducing post-Brexit governance and environmental principles also aims to deliver environmental improvements by introducing the ability to set legally binding targets relating to air quality, biodiversity, resource e ciency and waste reduction. Targets were originally due by Oct 2022 with compliance by 2037 but species targets (following on from nature positive policy changes) have already
been brought forward to 2030. Other target dates are set to follow. Developers will need to prepare for the introduction of air quality and biodiversity targets. <br><Br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><p><p>
Portfolios should be reviewed (and kept under continuous review) to identify environmental and sustainability issues for potential compliance risks, introduction and changes that may be necessary to meet new targets and to strengthen ESG principles in the sector.
This could include review of: environmental compliance – particularly around permits, consents, discharges and waste duty of care (where there is increasing enforcement and significant fine and reputational risk); access to environmental information and data management; asset resilience and optimisation – especially around smart assets, HVACs, retrofit and adaptation for meeting targets, and waste and end of life considerations. This may require amendments and green lease provisions should be considered (or enhanced if already in place)."
