<p>On 20 July 2021, HM Treasury published draft legislation and a summary of changes to the UK tax regime applicable to qualifying asset-holding companies (QAHCs) in fund structures managed by regulated fund managers or certain types of institutional investors, 70%+ of which are owned by diversely-owned investors. The changes are set to take effect from 1 April 2022 (stamp duty/SDRT/ corporation tax) and 6 April 2022 (income tax/CGT). They can be seen as part of a wider Government objective to encourage property fund structures to move on shore in the UK; recognising that the current legal regime, especially tax, has meant that most alternative property fund structures are established outside the UK. The proposals aim to address a series of tax issues that are thought to restrict the establishment of on shore structure, focusing on exempting QAHC profits from overseas properties and gains from certain shares and overseas properties, relaxing for QAHCs some of the restrictions on interest deductibility, exempting interest payments by QAHCs to investors from withholding tax and providing a more favourable tax treatment of share and loan capital buybacks by QAHCs from investors.</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>The introduction of the general non-resident CGT charge, to apply to both direct and indirect disposals of UK real estate interests has already lessened the attractions (and/or increased the complexity) of establishing and operating UK real estate fund structures in overseas jurisdictions. For those contemplating establishing new real estate funds, or already operating them, it will be worth considering the costs and benefits of the current arrangements, and how the position might be improved, as and when the changes come into effect. We are currently seeing a more general move towards 'on shoring' holding structures for higher value UK real estate assets.</p>"
Building Safety Levy,Prepare,Financial,TRUE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>On 21 July 2021, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government published a consultation on Building Safety Levy (previously referred to as ""Gateway 2 levy"" and originally announced on 10 February 2021). It is intended that the levy will come into force alongside the new Gateway 2 process in 2023. Like the Residential Property Developer Tax (RPDT), the levy is intended to help fill the funding gap left as a result of Government funding for cladding remediation. The levy is intended to be payable at Gateway 2 of the building control approval stage, though the paper moots the possibility of allowing instalment payments by SMEs. The paper proposes that hospitals and affordable housing are excluded from the scope of the levy but does not mention any exclusion for care homes (despite the Government having proposed some form of care home exemption from RPDT). The paper states that the levy will apply ""only to the largest residential developers"" but does not specify how any such distinction will be made (and this begs the question why it is felt necessary to cater for SMEs with the ability to pay by instalments). The paper does not give any indication as to what the rate of the levy will be.</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>It is difficult to plan ahead for the levy given the limited information provided in the paper as to scope, the lack of a rate and the fact the paper does not specify on what basis the levy will be calculated (it merely mentions payment by square footage or by residential unit as possible quantification mechanisms). High rise (i.e. 18M or higher or 7 storeys or higher) developers of residential property, care homes or hospitals therefore need to be alert for further updates in respect of the levy.</p>"

Residential Property Developer Tax (RPDT),Monitor,Financial,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>On 20 September, the Government published draft legislation and opened a technical consultation, on the Residential Property Developer Tax (RPDT), closing 15 October 2021. The draft legislation taxes corporate residential developers on so-called ""RPD activities"". Some types of property are out of scope - most notably purpose-built student accommodation - but other exclusions tend to be institutional. The scope of the carve-out for senior living is restricted to a ""home or other institution providing residential accommodation with personal care"". The draft legislation allows RPDT loss relief carry-forward and group relief but limits carry-forward relief to 50% of RPDT profits.</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>There are special provisions addressing the treatment of corporate JVs. Corporate shareholders in the JV with a 10%+ holding are allocated a proportionate share of the JV's RPDT profits falling under the annual allowance. Similarly, the parties can elect to transfer a proportionate share of RPDT losses to 10%+ shareholders in the JV. Where there are 10%+ shareholders in a corporate JV who are not themselves subject to RPDT (e.g. pension funds), the JV's annual allowance is restricted by a proportion equal to that shareholder's ownership proportion. In the case of some shareholders (such as individuals), this may mean a partnership JV could be more RPDT-efficient.</p>"

Building Safety Bill,Prepare,Compliance,TRUE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>The big ticket stuff in RE in will be the introduction of the post-Grenfell changes contained in the Fire Safety Act 2021 (FSA) and Building Safety Bill (BSB) which will essentially implement the recommendations of the Hackitt Report. Intending to clarify the scope of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, the FSA received Royal Assent and was passed into law on 29 April 2021.</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>Although the FSA applies to ""domestic premises"", we consider that the broad duties in the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 still apply and that the FSA sets out a best practice approach to the management of risk in high risk
premises. The external facade of a building (including cladding, windows and balconies) should now be included in a fire risk assessment, along with doors opening to the common parts of the buildings. Fire risk assessments should therefore be reviewed and revised as soon as possible. Buildings, starting with high-rise multi-occupation, are to e ectively have a ""safety passport"" which follows them from construction through into the occupation phase, including maintenance and refurbishment, and ties into a revamped building regulations regime. Those involved in construction and management of buildings will have strict legal duties to reduce and manage building risk, complementing existing duties under the CDM and fire safety regimes, together with a digital ""golden thread"" ensuring accessibility to key design information relating to a building's safety throughout its lifetime. The reformed regime will aim to join up everything that until now has sat separately - building regs, fire safety obligations, planning and ongoing duties of care under health and safety legislation. There will be a new regulatory body in the form of the Building Safety Regulator, which sits within the Health and Safety Executive and will be up and running within 12 to 18 months but note it is already operating in shadow form. We can share knowledge pieces we have prepared already once you need them but we encourage familiarity with the changes to law as industry will need to making its preparations before the BSB (laid before Parliament on 5 July 2021), comes into force in 2023."
Environment and Sustainability,Prepare,Compliance,TRUE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The real estate sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gases and major consumer of non-renewable energy sources. Globally, there continues to be a perception that the real estate sector lags behind other sectors in its response to environmental challenges, despite a growing number of diverse environmental standards at a building, portfolio, company ESG and Government policy level. The Environment Bill (due to be passed Autumn/Winter 2021 after amendment
to facilitate reduction to sewage discharges from storm overflows) along with introducing post-Brexit governance and environmental principles also aims to deliver environmental improvements by introducing the ability to set legally binding targets relating to air quality, biodiversity, resource e ciency and waste reduction. Targets were originally due by Oct 2022 with compliance by 2037 but species targets (following on from nature positive policy changes) have already
been brought forward to 2030. Other target dates are set to follow. Developers will need to prepare for the introduction of air quality and biodiversity targets. <br><Br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><p><p>
Portfolios should be reviewed (and kept under continuous review) to identify environmental and sustainability issues for potential compliance risks, introduction and changes that may be necessary to meet new targets and to strengthen ESG principles in the sector.
This could include review of: environmental compliance – particularly around permits, consents, discharges and waste duty of care (where there is increasing enforcement and significant fine and reputational risk); access to environmental information and data management; asset resilience and optimisation – especially around smart assets, HVACs, retrofit and adaptation for meeting targets, and waste and end of life considerations. This may require amendments and green lease provisions should be considered (or enhanced if already in place)."
