UK Green Finance Strategy,"The objectives of the Green Finance Strategy are to strengthen the competitiveness of the UK financial sector and to align private sector financial flows with clean, environmentally sustainable and resilient growth, supported by government action. The government will achieve the objectives via three strategic pillars:

""Greening Finance"": Mainstreaming climate and environmental factors as a financial and strategic imperative, by ensuring current and future financial risks and opportunities from climate and environmental factors are integrated into mainstream financial decision making, and that markets for green financial products are robust in nature.
""Financing Green"": Mobilising private finance for clean and resilient growth, by accelerating finance to support the delivery of the UK’s carbon targets and clean growth, resilience and environmental ambitions, as well as international objectives.
""Capturing the Opportunity"": Cementing UK leadership in green finance, by ensuring UK financial services capture the domestic and international commercial opportunities arising from the ‘greening of finance’, such as climate-related data and analytics, and from ‘financing green’, such as new green financial products and services.",Clients will need to follow the Strategy and the key steps included to ensure they are meeting all necessary requirements ahead of the UK's target to reach Net Zero by 2050.,Financial Regulation ,Plan
Sustainability disclosure and labelling regime,"On 31 May 2024, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published an update to the Sustainability disclosure and labelling regime webpage.

The webpage has been updated to reflect that the anti-greenwashing rule and guidance has now come into force. The FCA has also added a new 'Criteria' section that includes the following:

Sustainability objective: To qualify for a label, a product must have a sustainability objective that is clear, specific and measurable, and part of the product's investment objectives. The FCA states that referring to broad statements is unlikely to be specific. It also reminds firms subject to the consumer duty to consider the appropriate level of detail for their communications.
Key performance indicators (KPIs): A firm's pre-contractual disclosures must include details of the KPIs that will be used to measure progress towards meeting the sustainability objective, and other metrics that a retail client may reasonably find useful in understanding the investment policy and strategy for the product.
Stewardship: The FCA recognises that stewardship can take place in different forms. It explains that a disclosure should clearly disclose how the stewardship strategy supports delivery of the particular sustainability objective for the fund.
Asset classes: The FCA confirms that it is not being prescriptive around how certain assets should be treated.
Financing strategies: The FCA notes that aligned and aligning financing strategies are most likely to be found in ""sustainability improvers"" products. Both strategies direct financing to assets issued by companies that are still in transition. Therefore, even in the case of an aligned financing strategy, the investment is unlikely to already meet a reasonable investor's threshold for sustainability.",,,Action

Parker Review Recommendations,"The Parker Review, led by Sir John Parker, identified that minority ethnic directors were vastly under-represented on the boards of the UK’s leading companies. It recommended, in its first report in 2017, that there should be one director from a minority ethnic background on each FTSE 250 board by 2024. 

In March 2023, the Parker Review published an updated report and new targets were set out:

•	FTSE 350 companies will need to set their target for the percentage of senior management who identify as being from an ethnic minority background by December 2023 and then they will be required to meet this target by December 2027. 
•	50 of the UK's largest private companies have been set a target of having at least one director from an ethnic minority background on the main board by December 2027.

On 11 March 2024, the Parker Review Committee issued an update report. The scope of the Review was extended in 2023 and the report includes the data collected so far in relation to this extended scope. 

The report sets out (as at December 2023 and of the companies that responded to the relevant questions):
•	The percentage of companies with at least one ethnic minority director (96% of FTSE 100 companies, 70% of FTSE 250 companies and 44% of private companies).
•	The percentage of board directorships represented by ethnic minority directors (19% of FTSE 100 companies, 13.5% of FTSE 250 companies and 11% of private companies).
•	The average percentage of ethnic minority representation in senior management (13% of FTSE 100 companies and 12% of FTSE 250 companies).
•	The average target for the proportion of ethnic minority representation in senior management in 2027 (17%, although the range was from 5% to 45%, for FTSE 100 companies and 15.5% for the FTSE 250 companies).","If an entity is part of a group with an ultimate parent company that meets the criteria to which the recommendations of the Parker Review apply, these recommendations should be considered as part of any board succession planning.",Corporate Governance,Plan
UK Prospectus and Market Abuse Regulation,"The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (FSMA 2023) received royal assent on 29 June 2023. It will, when relevant sections are brought into force, revoke the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the UK Prospectus Regulation – both of which are part of retained EU law post Brexit. incorporates key reforms to the regulation of the UK Financial Services sector.  

Once the UK Prospectus Regulation and the UK Market Abuse Regulation have been revoked, the FCA will have the power to:
• set out guidelines on what inside information is and what the disclosure of inside information means; and
• determine when a prospectus is required and what its content should be.

On 29 January 2024, the Public Offers and Admissions to Trading Regulations 2024 were made. The Regulations create the statutory architecture for a new rules-based framework for regulating public offerings of securities and admissions to trading on regulated markets in the UK, replacing the existing EU-derived prospectus regime.

Although these regulations create a framework for the new regime, detailed requirements will be set out in the new FCA rules. The FCA has already sought views via a series of engagement papers.","The FCA is expected to publish a formal consultation on the detailed rules in the first half of 2024. The new regime will come into force after the FCA has completed its consultation exercise.

Diversity and inclusion in the financial sector ,"On 25 September 2023, the FCA Published ""Consultation Paper 23/20: Diversity and inclusion in the financial sector - working together to drive change"" (CP 23/20) which contains proposals to introduce a new regulatory framework on diversity and inclusion in the financial sector. 

Proposals in CP 23/20 will require in-scope firms to do the following:
•	report their average number of employees to the FCA on an annual basis;
•	establish, implement and maintain a diversity and inclusion strategy;
•	collect, report and disclose certain diversity and inclusion data;
•	determine and set appropriate diversity targets; and
•	recognise a lack of diversity and inclusion as a non-financial risk.
The PRA has also published its own proposals regarding diversity and inclusion in PRA-regulated firms (in its ""Consultation Paper 18/23 - Diversity and inclusion in PRA-regulated firms""), with the regulators working closely to develop a consistent and coordinated set of proposals for consultation.","Most of these requirements (around setting targets, regulatory reporting and disclosure) would be applicable only to the largest firms (as defined and set out in further detail in the consultation paper).",Corporate Governance,Prepare
Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023,"On 26 October 2023, the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill received Royal Assent, becoming the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (ECCTA 2023).

Key changes include the following:
•	introduction of an identity verification regime for new and existing directors, LLP members and PSCs. This new identity verification regime is not included in this list of early measures.
•	Restriction on the use of corporate directors of UK companies (via the Small Business Enterprise and Employment Act).
•	UK limited partnerships changes: (i) requiring a connection with the UK; (ii) increasing registration and transparency requirements; and (iii) enabling Companies House to deregister limited partnerships.
•	to widen the scope of corporate criminal liability by creating a new offence of failure to prevent fraud committed by employees or agents. The government has stuck with plans to apply the offence to businesses that meet two of three criteria: they have 250 employees, £36m (US$43.5m) in sales or £18m in assets. Companies will have a defence for breaching the law by proving they had set up compliance controls intended to prevent fraud. 
•	extending senior manager attribution liability from 26 December 2023 – it will be possible for a corporate to be found criminally liable for certain offences committed by a 'senior manager', so long as they were acting within the 'actual or apparent scope of their authority' when they did the criminal act. The definition of a senior manager is broader than director and is based on role and responsibilities rather than job description. This would apply to any body corporate, partnership or limited partnership, wherever it is formed or operates.
•	Improvements to the quality of financial information on the register - there will be a requirement to file accounts in iXBRL format.
•	Enhanced reporting of company accounting information.

On 1 March 2024, The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (Commencement No. 2 and Transitional Provision) Regulations 2024 (SI 2024/269) were published. Regulation 2 provides that most of the provisions of Part 1 of ECCTA will come into force on 4 March 2024. The mandatory identity verification regime for new and existing directors, PSCs and those filing documents at Companies House is excluded as expected (these changes are anticipated later in 2024). Alongside with these reforms, the government's existing power under s87(4) Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 to restrict the use of corporate directors was also implemented on 4 March 2024 for the purpose of bringing into force section 156B (power to provide for exceptions from requirement that each director be a natural person). This is under the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (Commencement No. 8) Regulations 2024. The regulations setting out these exceptions are unlikely to be published until the ID verification provisions are commenced. 

The 4 March changes cover the following: 
•	introducing the Registrar's new objectives and greater powers to check, query and reject information and request supporting evidence; 
•	stronger checks on company names; 
•	new rules for an 'appropriate' registered office address (so no PO Boxes); 
•	a requirement to supply a registered email address; 
•	a requirement for all companies to confirm they are forming the company for a lawful purpose when they incorporate, and to confirm its intended future activities will be lawful on their annual confirmation statement (CS01); 
•	the ability for the Registrar to annotate the register when information appears confusing or misleading; 
•	taking steps to clean up the register, using data matching to identify and remove inaccurate information; 
•	sharing data with other government departments and law enforcement agencies;
•	greater protection for personal information on the register;
•	increased civil and criminal sanctions to reflect new obligations – these include a new aggravated offence for delivering false statements to the registrar and a new civil penalties regime allowing the registrar to impose a financial penalty for many CA 2006 offences; and
•	directors and disqualification – a director will cease to hold office if disqualified under the disqualification regime.  Section 31, which expands the grounds on which a director can be disqualified to include persistent breaches of certain companies' legislation, has not come into force.

The following secondary legislation has been made under ECCTA which came into force on 4 March 2024:
•	the Registered Office Address (Rectification of Register) Regulations 2024 give the registrar power to change a company's registered office address to a default address where satisfied that it is not an 'appropriate address';
•	the Service Address (Rectification of Register) Regulations 2024 give the registrar similar rectification powers in relation to registered service addresses of a director, secretary, PSC or RLE to a default address; 
•	the Principal Office Address (Rectification of Register) Regulations 2024 give the registrar similar rectification powers in relation to the principal office address of a director, secretary, PSC or RLE to a default address; and
•	the Limited Liability Partnerships (Application of Company Law) Regulations 2024 which provide for the application of certain reforms under ECCTA 2023 to LLPs.

Companies House has also published updated guidance and forms to reflect the 4 March changes.","Clients should monitor the government's implementation timetable and plan key actions accordingly. 

For example, UK incorporated companies will need ensure that all directors, PSCs (and Relevant Legal Entities) (and, where relevant, officers of such entities) and other persons filing on behalf of UK companies, LLPs and LPs have had their identity verified via one of the 2 methods for Identity Verification in order that each such individual obtains a unique identifier number to ensure it can continue to act in its appointed function.

Groups should also review their current corporate group structure to identify   whether has any UK corporate directors and, if so, take early steps to comply with the new verification requirements applying to natural persons acting as directors and/or any existing corporate directors.

Any new UK incorporated subsidiaries will need to comply with these measures as part of the incorporation process, which may add time and expense to set-up.

On an ongoing basis, UK incorporated companies should take due care when making filings in respect of its UK incorporated group companies (including, without limitation, whether any such companies will, upon the relevant parts of the Act becoming effective, the requirement to comply with the more rigorous financial reporting requirements that will be imposed on all micro entities and small and dormant companies).

UK incorporated companies will need to provide both a registered email address (to be supplied to Companies House and to which it can send communications) and a lawful purpose statement – when filing their next confirmation statement with a statement date from 5 March 2024. They will also need to ensure that at all times, their registered office is an ""appropriate registered office address"".

UK incorporated companies should discuss with their (group) accountants whether they are set-up to file using the new software-only filing system to be introduced by the Act (i.e., paper and Web filing will no longer be permitted).

If groups have any limited partnerships in their group structure, the filing and disclosure obligations will become more burdensome.",Corporate Governance,Monitor
Withdrawal of the draft Companies Regulations 2023,"On 16 October 2023, the Department for Business and Trade announced that the government has withdrawn the draft Companies (Strategic Report and Directors' Report) (Amendment) Regulations 2023, in response to concerns raised by companies about the imposition of additional reporting requirements. These had been laid before parliament in July 2023.

They would have added certain additional corporate and company reporting requirements to large UK listed and private companies with ""a high level of employees and turnover"" (broadly companies with 750 or more employees and turnover of at least £750m). These would have included an annual resilience statement, distributable profits figure, material fraud statement and triennial audit and assurance policy statement.

In consultation, companies raised concerns about these additional reporting requirements which would have involved them incurring extra costs by requiring them to include additional corporate information in their annual reports.","The government will instead be proposing a new reform package that aims to deliver a more targeted, simpler and effective reporting framework for both business and investors.

In addition, the announcement also confirms that the government remains committed to the wider audit and governance reform, including establishing ARGA to replace the FRC and that legislation will be brought forward to deliver these reforms where Parliamentary time allows.",Corporate Governance,Plan
FRC publishes revised UK Corporate Governance Code,"On 22 January 2024, the FRC announced the publication of revisions to the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. Alongside a revised version of the UKCG Code, the FRC has also published certain supporting materials. On 29 January 2024, the FRC published guidance to accompany the revised version of the Code – although not mandatory, it is intended to support those applying the updated Code and consolidates previously published guidance into a single document.

Following the withdrawal of the draft Companies (Strategic Report and Directors' Report) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 and the FRC's policy update in November 2023, certain amendments included in the consultation version of the Code have not been incorporated into the final version. One of the drivers for the FRC's decision to scale back the reform of the Corporate Governance Code is the concern from businesses about the introduction of yet more corporate reporting obligations.","Key changes include the following:
1. Governance reporting should focus on board decisions and their outcomes. New Principle C states that where the board reports on departures from the Code's provisions, it should provide a clear explanation.

2. The requirement to assess and monitor how the company's desired culture has been embedded.

3. Board appointments and succession planning should promote diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity. The list of diversity characteristics has been removed to reflect that diversity policies can be wide ranging.

4. Monitoring and review of the company's risk management and internal control framework should cover all material controls, including financial, operational, reporting and compliance controls. Furthermore, the Code has been amended to include a requirement that the board should include in the annual report (i) a description of how the board has monitored and reviewed the effectiveness of the framework and (ii) a declaration of the effectiveness of the material controls as at the balance date sheet. There is also a requirement to include a description of any material controls which have not operated effectively as at the balance sheet date, the action taken, or proposed, to improve them and any action taken to address previously reported issues.

5. Directors' contracts and/or any other agreements relate to director remuneration should include malus and clawback. In addition, a description of a company's malus and clawback provisions should be included in the annual report.",Corporate Governance,Prepare
Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive,"The Directive establishes a corporate due diligence duty.  It aims to foster responsible corporate behaviour and to anchor human rights and environmental considerations in companies’ operations and corporate governance. The new rules will ensure that businesses address adverse impacts of their actions, including in their value chains. Such impact will include slavery, child labour, labour exploitation, biodiversity loss, pollution or destruction of natural heritage.

Large EU companies and non-EU companies with significant EU activity will need to identify, prevent, mitigate, end and account for certain adverse human rights and environmental impacts. The recently adopted text makes several substantive changes to the original Commission proposal, including increasing the applicable thresholds for in scope companies, now set at over 1000 employees and a worldwide turnover above 450m euro.","If there is a likelihood of these thresholds being met, an early impact assessment of current internal policies would be advisable in order for the in-scope entity to assess whether any revisions would be necessary to internal policies and procedures to ensure that the in-scope entity can meet the standards imposed by the due diligence duty etc.",Corporate Governance,Action
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive,"The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (""CSRD"") has been in force since 5 January 2023. 

The CSRD seeks to make businesses more publicly accountable by creating new rules requiring them to regularly disclose information on their societal and environmental impact. This is an attempt to address 'greenwashing' concerns and address shortcomings within existing legislation on the disclosure of non-financial information.

The CSRD requires in-scope companies to report on sustainability-related issues in line with the detailed set of disclosure standards developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (""EFRAG""). 

The CSRD extends to large and listed EU companies, as well as to large third country companies which do substantial business in the EU or have securities listed on EU regulated markets.","The CSRD will apply for large public-interest companies (PIEs) (with over 500 employees) that are already subject to Directive 2014/95/EU (the Non-Financial Reporting Directive). In practice, this will capture all listed companies plus large companies that exceed 2 of the 3 of the following:
• Balance sheet total: > EUR 20M
• Net revenue: > EUR 40M
• > 250 average number of employees during the FY

It will also apply to non-EU companies (i.e. large UK corporate) with substantial activity in the EU will be in-scope for CSRD reporting. 

A third-party country legal entity will be in-scope if it meets the following criteria:

1. Net turnover of EUR 150 million in the EU for each of the last two consecutive financial years; and
2. At least one subsidiary or branch in the EU which:
3. For a subsidiary: meets the criteria for categories (2) or (3) above; and
4. For a branch: has a turnover of more than EUR 40 million

The CSRD will require in-scope companies to disclose information on 'sustainability matters' that affect it (and its group), as well as the impacts on sustainability matters (the so-called 'double materiality' principle).  In particular, the CSRD will require management reports to include information on:

• the resilience of the company's business model and strategy to sustainability risks;
• plans ensuring compatibility with the 1.5°C global warming target under the Paris Agreement regarding climate neutrality by 2050 and exposure to coal, oil and gas related activities.",Corporate Governance,Prepare

The Phase 1 proposals should be in place by the 2024 auctions and the Phase 2 proposals are subject to a further consultation, which opened on 16 October 2023 and closed on 8 December 2023.","Clients should ensure they are familiar with the proposals. Phase 1 proposals include:
An extension to the temporary arrangements removing barriers to mothballed plant entering the Capacity Market (with a more enduring solution falling into phase 2).
A temporary delay to the requirement for fossil fuel emissions declaration verification from prequalification 2023 to 2024 with any verification carried out in 2023 also being valid in 2024. This is to mitigate the risks of low numbers of accredited Independent Emissions Verifiers available for the 2023 prequalification window.

The Phase 2 proposals are designed to improve security of supply and accelerate investment in low carbon technologies, including battery storage and demand side response. They include:

Green Deal industrial plan,"In February 2023, the European Commission published a Communication entitled ""A Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net-Zero Age"".

The plan enhances the competitiveness of Europe's net-zero industry and is accelerating the transition to climate neutrality. It does so by creating a more supportive environment for scaling up the EU's manufacturing capacity for the net-zero technologies and products required to meet Europe's ambitious climate targets.

It covers four key pillars
●	Predictable and simplified regulatory environment
●	Faster access to funding
●	Enhancing skills
●	Open trade for resilient supply chains

Initiatives of the plan include:

The Net-Zero Industry Act which identifies goals for net-zero industrial capacity and provides a regulatory framework suited for its quick deployment.

The Critical Raw Materials Act – ensuring sufficient access to materials.

The reform of electricity market design – helping consumer benefit from the lower cost of renewables.

The use of harmonised sustainability and circularity requirements in public procurement can help create a more predictable demand for net-zero products and solutions.

The Commission will also facilitate the use of existing EU funds for financing clean tech innovation, manufacturing and deployment, with a focus on REPowerEU, InvestEU and the Innovation Fund. The Commission will also look to set up the European Sovereignty Fund.","To achieve these objectives, the availability of green technologies and products, such as photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, heat pumps, hydrogen electrolysers, batteries and carbon capture and storage equipment will need to be secured.

The Green Deal Industrial Plan will create an attractive environment for net-zero investments, so that the EU manufacturing capacity for these products is strengthened and demand satisfied.",IPE,Plan

This sought views on the introduction of a market-based mechanism to support investment and innovation in transforming the consumer proposition for heat pumps. The Energy Act 2023 contains provisions to implement a market-based mechanism for low-carbon heat (the Clean Heat Market Mechanism).

As of March 2024, DESNZ is now inviting views on plans to adjust the date of introduction of the Clean Heat Market Mechanism scheme to 1 April 2025.","This scheme will impact gas boiler manufacturers, who will have to match a certain percentage (increasing each year) of boiler sales with sales of heat pumps.",Environment and Sustainability ,Prepare
UK publishes transport adaptation strategy,"The Department for Transport has launched the transport adaptation strategy, which includes actions and policies designed to improve the UK transport system into one that is flexible, reliable, operates safely and is responsive to a changing climate. The first stage of the strategy is a consultation on the proposals, launched in April 2024.","The transport adaptation strategy has three overarching objectives:
o	helping the transport sector understand the need to adapt business and operations to the changing climate, building their response into ‘business as usual’;
o	encouraging the transport sector to utilise available guidance and tools to support them in prioritising investments on adaptation and sharing information to galvanise adaptation action; and
o	ensuring the Department for Transport (DfT) sets the strategic direction for the transport sector, enhancing adaptation action and fostering cross-sector collaboration.",Environment and Sustainability ,Prepare
RAAC,"Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (RAAC) is present in many buildings constructed between the 1950s and mid-1990s (approximately) and has made headline news recently.
Due to its construction, RAAC tends to be much weaker and more susceptible to degradation than traditional concrete, resulting in failure. The aerated structure means that moisture can easily penetrate and cause weakness, also causing steel reinforcements to rust and weaken. With an estimated life span of 30 years the last known RAAC produced in the UK is now beyond its design life expectancy, raising a number of health and safety concerns for buildings which contain it – most importantly, those buildings could be at risk of collapse with little or no notice.","Whilst the headlines relating to RAAC have largely focussed on public sector buildings, RAAC could be (and has been found to be) present in other types of buildings as well.
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has advised owners or managers of estates to identify RAAC in their buildings and seek specialist advice to assess and manage such risks from its use.  
Retail occupiers of affected premises need to be aware of the extent of their obligations under repair and service charge under their leases and to also consider the terms of their property and business interruption insurance.",Environment and Sustainability ,Plan
Biodiversity Net Gain,"From 12 February 2024, all planning permissions (subject to exceptions) granted in England pursuant to planning applications submitted under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 on or after this date are subject to a condition requiring that the biodiversity value attributable to the development exceeds the pre-development value of the onsite habitat by at least 10%.","BNG is an approach to development that leaves the biodiversity of a site in a better state than before. While BNG is already a planning consideration, the new rules will mandate requirements to satisfy BNG as a planning condition. 
BNG requires all future development projects in England (subject to some exceptions) to deliver a minimum 10% BNG, to be maintained for a period of at least 30 years. BNG for small sites remains targeted to commence, from 2 April 2024, and implementation for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects remains targeted for 2025.",Environment and Sustainability ,Plan
Guidance on calculating nutrient neutrality,"Natural England and the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs have released a collection of tools and resources for calculating nutrient neutrality.",Nutrient neutrality means that a new residential development will not cause increased nutrient pollution to specific habitat sites. Developers must use nutrient budget calculations to show that their proposals will not result in a net increase in nutrient pollution to 27 specific habitat sites. Developers can use the nutrient neutrality calculators to complete a nutrient budget to support a planning application and local planning authorities can use them to understand the mitigation requirements for future.,Environment and Sustainability ,Plan
EPCS/MEES,"From 1 April 2023, it has been unlawful for a landlord to continue to let/sublet a commercial property with an EPC rating of ""F"" or ""G"". The minimum standard (an EPC rating of ""E"") needs to be met to continue letting properties under existing leases unless; the MEES Regulations don't apply; the landlord has carried out all cost-effective energy efficiency works, and the property remains sub-standard; or other registered exemptions under the MEES Regulations apply.","These regulations apply in England and Wales only. The impact of this change will depend on a variety of factors e.g., the current EPC rating of commercial property assets and the relevant lease terms regarding MEES compliance/works.

Clients with commercial property assets should assess their portfolio's EPC ratings and lease terms.",Environment and Sustainability ,Plan

ICO publishes new fining guidance,"On 18 March the ICO announced that it had published new data protection fining guidance setting out how it decides to issue penalties and calculate fines. 
The guidance covers:
•	The provisions of the UK GDPR and DPA 2018 in respect of which the Commissioner can impose a fine. Annexes 1 and 2 set out these provisions and which level of fine applies to each. The guidance does not cover fines for breach of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR).
•	The concept of an ""undertaking"". The Commissioner may hold a parent company jointly and severally liable for breaches of its subsidiary.
•	The approach where there is more than one infringement. This differs depending on whether the infringement relates to the same or linked processing operations, or separate conduct.
•	The circumstances in which the Commissioner would consider it appropriate to issue a penalty notice.  The relevant factors are: (i) the seriousness of the infringement, (ii) relevant aggravating or mitigating factors, and (iii) whether issuing a privacy notice in each case is effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
•	The 5-step methodology for calculating a fine: (i) assess the seriousness of the infringement, (ii) account for turnover, (iii) calculate the starting point, (iv) take into account aggravating and mitigating factors, and (v) adjust to ensure the fine is effective, proportionate and dissuasive. ","This does not change the law, but Federated Hermes may wish to review the guidance to assess the risk of non-compliance with data protection law. No action needed – included to help FH assess the risk of non-compliance with data protection law.",Data Protection,Monitor
ICO biometric data guidance,"On 23 February the ICO published the first phase of its guidance on biometric data and biometric technologies. This first phase deals with biometric recognition and was previously published for consultation last year. The guidance covers:
•	Key data protection concepts
•	Biometric recognition 
•	How do we demonstrate our compliance with our data protection obligations? 
•	How do we process biometric data lawfully? 
•	How do we process biometric data fairly? 
•	How does the accuracy principle apply to biometric data?
•	How do we ensure our processing of biometric data is transparent? 
•	How do we consider rights requests for biometric data? 
•	How do we keep biometric data secure?","While ICO guidance is not the law, it provides guidance on how to use biometric technologies in compliance with data protection law and indicates how the ICO intends to enforce the law.
The ICO has recently ordered Serco Leisure and associated community leisure trusts to stop using FRT (facial recognition technology) and fingerprint scanning to monitor workers’ attendance, showing that this is a key enforcement area for the ICO. If FH is collecting and using biometric data, it needs to ensure that it complies with existing data protection law. The draft guidance will assist it to identify the issues and how to address them, but FH may wish to seek external advice, as this is a complex area.

ICO cookies warning,"The ICO has announced that it has written to companies running many of the UK’s most visited websites setting out their concerns about ""reject all"" buttons and giving them 30 days to ensure that their websites comply with the law.
On 31 January the ICO published a short update on the letters that it sent in November 2023. The key points are:
•	Of the 53 organisations contacted, 38 organisations have changed their cookies banners to be compliant and four have committed to reach compliance within the next month.
•	Several others are working to develop alternative solutions, including contextual advertising and subscription models. The ICO will provide further clarity on how these models can be implemented in compliance with data protection law in the next month.
•	The ICO is already preparing to write to the next 100 websites – and the 100 after that.
•	The ICO is developing an AI solution to help identify websites using non-compliant cookie banners and will run a ‘hackathon’ event early in 2024 to explore what this AI solution might look like in practice.","The ICO is proactively enforcing the rules about cookie banners, so FH should ensure that its cookie use complies with data protection law, including the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) and the UK GDPR. If FH has received one of these letters, it should consider how to respond to the ICO to avoid being ""named and shamed"". In addition, it should review the law and guidance on cookies to ensure that its websites are compliant.",Data Protection,Prepare
CNIL fines Amazon for excessive employee monitoring,"On 23 January the CNIL (the French data protection authority) announced that it had fined Amazon France Logistique €32 million for:
•	having set up an excessively intrusive system for monitoring the activity and performance of employees; and
•	conducting video surveillance without providing sufficient information and putting in place sufficient security.
CNIL identified breaches of the following provisions of GDPR:
•	Article 5(1)(c): data minimisation
•	Article 6: lawfulness of processing (Amazon relied on legitimate interests, but the CNIL considered that the processing was excessively intrusive)
•	Articles 12 and 13: transparency and information
•	Article 32: security","While this decision is from the French data protection authority, the ICO's recent guidance and enforcement action against Serco (see the entry on biometric guidance) indicates that this is a priority enforcement area for the ICO. If FH monitors its workers it should ensure that such monitoring is proportionate, it keeps the data obtained secure, and that it provides transparent information to its workers.

Cold calling ban for consumer financial services ,"HM Treasury published a consultation and call for evidence on extending the existing ban on cold calling about pensions to all financial services and products. Some of the key points are:
•	The proposal forms part of the government's Fraud Strategy and is aimed at blocking fraud attempts. The principle is that the public should be made aware that no legitimate firms would use cold calls to market financial services or products, so any cold call must be a scam.
•	The consultation is seeking views on how best to design and implement the ban to prevent scam calls, while allowing legitimate and beneficial communications from businesses to continue.
•	The proposal is to extend the ban on calls for direct marketing in relation to pension schemes under Regulation 21B of PECR to all consumer financial services and products. There is also a suggestion that the ban should be extended to cover live electronic communications (e.g. video and voice calls over social media).
•	The consultation document recognises that there may be circumstances where calls may provide benefits to consumers, where permitted under the existing legislation.
•	It asks whether the existing exception under Regulation 21B(3) of PECR for FCA/PRA authorised businesses where there is an existing client relationship between the caller and the recipient and the relationship is such that the recipient might reasonably envisage receiving unsolicited calls for the purpose of direct marketing in relation to occupational pension schemes or personal pension schemes should also provide an exception to the proposed ban.","If the proposal becomes law, there is a risk that legitimate businesses will be unable to promote their products and services. We have included this for information only at this time. ",Data Protection,Monitor 
Data Protection and Digital Information Bill,"The Bill contains only minor changes from the original Data Protection and Digital Information Bill, but it is intended to make UK data protection law more flexible in a number of areas, including cookie use, the definition of ""personal data"", further processing for a purpose compatible with the original purpose, the rules on when an organisation can refuse a subject access request, the rules on data protection impact assessments, the requirement to maintain a record of processing activity (RoPA) and security requirements. The replacement of the requirement to appoint a DPO with the requirement to appoint a Senior Responsible Individual (SRI) may require National Grid to change its governance structure. 

The reforms to the UK GDPR will predominantly be relevant to UK-based organisations which are not caught by the geographical scope of the EU GDPR.    
The UK Government has stated that organisations which are already compliant with the current UK GDPR and the EU GDPR will not need to make any changes in order to comply with the reforms introduced in the Bill. However, the requirement to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) is being replaced with a requirement to appoint a ""senior responsible individual"" (SRI), which will operate differently.

The increase in the level of fines proposed for breaches of the electronic direct marketing rules under the PECRs will likely have a significant impact, as this is an area where the ICO is quite active. This will significantly increase the risk associated with running direct marketing campaigns which potentially contravene the PECRs.","Because the Bill has been dropped as a result of the announcement of general election, there is no need to take any action, as it now appears unlikely that the Bill will become law in its current form. If the Bill becomes law, National Grid would need to review its data protection governance to consider whether any processes need to be updated. AG will continue to monitor the parties' manifestos for proposals relating to data protection law and regulation.",Data Protection,Plan
EU AI Act,"On 13 March the European Parliament approved the EU AI Act. The regulation is still subject to a final lawyer-linguist check and needs to be formally endorsed by the Council (which has indicated that it would adopt the Act if the Parliament approved it).
The Act regulates the use of AI systems that will affect people located in the EU. The Act:
•	creates four risk levels:
o	Unacceptable risk (e.g., subliminal techniques that case harm) – prohibited
o	High risk (e.g., recruitment or selection of individuals) – strict obligations concerning governance, transparency, safety and control
o	Limited risk – transparency obligations only (i.e., chatbots must make it clear the user is interacting with a machine)
o	Minimal risk – voluntary code of conduct only
•	imposes obligations on providers of general-purpose AI models, according to the level of risk they are considered to present
•	establishes a European AI Board
•	provides for fines of up to 7% of global revenue or €35 million","The Act will regulate the use of AI systems that affect people in the EU, even if the system's supplier or deployer is based outside the EU. If FH proposes to use AI in a way that will affect people (e.g., employees, agents/distributors or customers) in the EU, it should keep abreast of these developments.",Data Protection,Plan
UK approach to AI regulation ,"DSIT published the government's long-awaited response to the consultation on its AI white paper on 6 February. In its response: 
•	The government maintains its stance that some mandatory measures will ultimately be required across all jurisdictions to address potential AI-related harms, ensure public safety, and enable individual to realise the transformative opportunities the technology offers. However, at present, the government has chosen not to introduce AI-specific legislation.
•	The government remains committed to the five cross-sectoral principles proposed in the white paper: (i) Safety, security and robustness; (ii) Appropriate transparency and explainability; (iii) Fairness; (iv) Accountability and governance; (v) Contestability and redress.
•	The government has written to a number of regulators impacted by AI (including the ICO) to ask them to publish an update outlining their strategic approach to AI by 30 April 2024.
•	DSIT will provide updated guidance in spring 2024 to ensure the use of AI in HR and recruitment is safe, responsible and fair. 
•	DSIT is working closely with the Equality and Human Rights Commission to develop new solutions to address bias and discrimination in AI systems.
•	The DPDI Bill expands the lawful bases on which solely automated decisions that have significant effects on individuals will take place.
•	The CMA will take steps to ensure that AI markets work well for all.
•	Later this year, DSIT will launch the AI Management Essentials scheme, setting a minimum good practice standard for companies selling AI products and services.
•	The government will continue to promote safe, secure and trustworthy AI.
•	The government is exploring if and how to introduce targeted measures on developers of highly capable general-purpose AI systems related to transparency requirements (for example, on training data), risk management, and accountability and corporate governance related obligations.
•	The Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum (DRCF) AI and Digital Hub will launch in spring 2024. This will be a pilot multi-regulator advisory service, bringing together the CMA, ICO, Ofcom and the FCA. The pilot phase will focus on providing compliance support.
A private members' bill to introduce AI regulation has passed its second reading in the House of Lords, but this is not expected to become law.
On 15 April, FT reported that the UK government is beginning to craft new legislation to regulate artificial intelligence. Such legislation would probably put limits on the production of large language models, the general-purpose technology that underlies AI products such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. No timeline has been announced yet.","Included for information only at this time. FH must use AI systems in compliance with existing laws and guidance, including the UK GDPR and the AI guidance issued by the ICO.",Data Protection,Monitor
