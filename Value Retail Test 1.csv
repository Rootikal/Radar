Parker Review Recommendations,Plan,Corporate Governance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Parker Review, led by Sir John Parker, identified that minority ethnic directors were vastly under-represented on the boards of the UK’s leading companies. It recommended, in its first report in 2017, that there should be one director from a minority ethnic background on each FTSE 250 board by 2024. 
<br><br>
In March 2023, the Parker Review published an updated report and new targets were set out:
<br><br>
•	FTSE 350 companies will need to set their target for the percentage of senior management who identify as being from an ethnic minority background by December 2023 and then they will be required to meet this target by December 2027. <br>
•	50 of the UK's largest private companies have been set a target of having at least one director from an ethnic minority background on the main board by December 2027.<br><br>

On 11 March 2024, the Parker Review Committee issued an update report. The scope of the Review was extended in 2023 and the report includes the data collected so far in relation to this extended scope. <br><br>

The report sets out (as at December 2023 and of the companies that responded to the relevant questions):<br>
•	The percentage of companies with at least one ethnic minority director (96% of FTSE 100 companies, 70% of FTSE 250 companies and 44% of private companies).<br>
•	The percentage of board directorships represented by ethnic minority directors (19% of FTSE 100 companies, 13.5% of FTSE 250 companies and 11% of private companies).<br>
•	The average percentage of ethnic minority representation in senior management (13% of FTSE 100 companies and 12% of FTSE 250 companies).<br>
•	The average target for the proportion of ethnic minority representation in senior management in 2027 (17%, although the range was from 5% to 45%, for FTSE 100 companies and 15.5% for the FTSE 250 companies).<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>If an entity is part of a group with an ultimate parent company that meets the criteria to which the recommendations of the Parker Review apply, these recommendations should be considered as part of any board succession planning.

UK Prospectus and Market Abuse Regulation,Prepare,Corporate Governance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (FSMA 2023) received royal assent on 29 June 2023. It will, when relevant sections are brought into force, revoke the UK Market Abuse Regulation and the UK Prospectus Regulation – both of which are part of retained EU law post Brexit. incorporates key reforms to the regulation of the UK Financial Services sector.  
<br><br>
Once the UK Prospectus Regulation and the UK Market Abuse Regulation have been revoked, the FCA will have the power to:<br>
• set out guidelines on what inside information is and what the disclosure of inside information means; and<br>
• determine when a prospectus is required and what its content should be.
<br><br>
On 29 January 2024, the Public Offers and Admissions to Trading Regulations 2024 were made. The Regulations create the statutory architecture for a new rules-based framework for regulating public offerings of securities and admissions to trading on regulated markets in the UK, replacing the existing EU-derived prospectus regime.<br><br>

Although these regulations create a framework for the new regime, detailed requirements will be set out in the new FCA rules. The FCA has already sought views via a series of engagement papers.
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>The FCA is expected to publish a formal consultation on the detailed rules in the first half of 2024. The new regime will come into force after the FCA has completed its consultation exercise.<br><br>

Listed companies should monitor the progress of this closely.</p>"
Diversity and inclusion in the financial sector ,Prepare,Corporate Governance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>On 25 September 2023, the FCA Published ""Consultation Paper 23/20: Diversity and inclusion in the financial sector - working together to drive change"" (CP 23/20) which contains proposals to introduce a new regulatory framework on diversity and inclusion in the financial sector. 
<br><br>
Proposals in CP 23/20 will require in-scope firms to do the following:<br>
•	report their average number of employees to the FCA on an annual basis;<br>
•	establish, implement and maintain a diversity and inclusion strategy;<br>
•	collect, report and disclose certain diversity and inclusion data;<br>
•	determine and set appropriate diversity targets; and<br>
•	recognise a lack of diversity and inclusion as a non-financial risk.<br><br>
The PRA has also published its own proposals regarding diversity and inclusion in PRA-regulated firms (in its ""Consultation Paper 18/23 - Diversity and inclusion in PRA-regulated firms""), with the regulators working closely to develop a consistent and coordinated set of proposals for consultation.
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Most of these requirements (around setting targets, regulatory reporting and disclosure) would be applicable only to the largest firms (as defined and set out in further detail in the consultation paper).</p>"
Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023,Monitor,Corporate Governance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>On 26 October 2023, the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill received Royal Assent, becoming the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (ECCTA 2023).<br><br>

Key changes include the following:<br>
•	introduction of an identity verification regime for new and existing directors, LLP members and PSCs. This new identity verification regime is not included in this list of early measures.<br>
•	Restriction on the use of corporate directors of UK companies (via the Small Business Enterprise and Employment Act).<br>
•	UK limited partnerships changes: (i) requiring a connection with the UK; (ii) increasing registration and transparency requirements; and (iii) enabling Companies House to deregister limited partnerships.<br>
•	to widen the scope of corporate criminal liability by creating a new offence of failure to prevent fraud committed by employees or agents. The government has stuck with plans to apply the offence to businesses that meet two of three criteria: they have 250 employees, £36m (US$43.5m) in sales or £18m in assets. Companies will have a defence for breaching the law by proving they had set up compliance controls intended to prevent fraud. <br>
•	extending senior manager attribution liability from 26 December 2023 – it will be possible for a corporate to be found criminally liable for certain offences committed by a 'senior manager', so long as they were acting within the 'actual or apparent scope of their authority' when they did the criminal act. The definition of a senior manager is broader than director and is based on role and responsibilities rather than job description. This would apply to any body corporate, partnership or limited partnership, wherever it is formed or operates.<br>
•	Improvements to the quality of financial information on the register - there will be a requirement to file accounts in iXBRL format.<br>
•	Enhanced reporting of company accounting information.<br>
<br>
On 1 March 2024, The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (Commencement No. 2 and Transitional Provision) Regulations 2024 (SI 2024/269) were published. Regulation 2 provides that most of the provisions of Part 1 of ECCTA will come into force on 4 March 2024. The mandatory identity verification regime for new and existing directors, PSCs and those filing documents at Companies House is excluded as expected (these changes are anticipated later in 2024). Alongside with these reforms, the government's existing power under s87(4) Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 to restrict the use of corporate directors was also implemented on 4 March 2024 for the purpose of bringing into force section 156B (power to provide for exceptions from requirement that each director be a natural person). This is under the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (Commencement No. 8) Regulations 2024. The regulations setting out these exceptions are unlikely to be published until the ID verification provisions are commenced. <br><br>

The 4 March changes cover the following: <br>
•	introducing the Registrar's new objectives and greater powers to check, query and reject information and request supporting evidence; <br>
•	stronger checks on company names; <br>
•	new rules for an 'appropriate' registered office address (so no PO Boxes); <br>
•	a requirement to supply a registered email address; <br>
•	a requirement for all companies to confirm they are forming the company for a lawful purpose when they incorporate, and to confirm its intended future activities will be lawful on their annual confirmation statement (CS01); <br>
•	the ability for the Registrar to annotate the register when information appears confusing or misleading; <br>
•	taking steps to clean up the register, using data matching to identify and remove inaccurate information; <br>
•	sharing data with other government departments and law enforcement agencies;<br>
•	greater protection for personal information on the register;<br>
•	increased civil and criminal sanctions to reflect new obligations – these include a new aggravated offence for delivering false statements to the registrar and a new civil penalties regime allowing the registrar to impose a financial penalty for many CA 2006 offences; and<br>
•	directors and disqualification – a director will cease to hold office if disqualified under the disqualification regime.  Section 31, which expands the grounds on which a director can be disqualified to include persistent breaches of certain companies' legislation, has not come into force.<br>
<br>
The following secondary legislation has been made under ECCTA which came into force on 4 March 2024:<br>
•	the Registered Office Address (Rectification of Register) Regulations 2024 give the registrar power to change a company's registered office address to a default address where satisfied that it is not an 'appropriate address';<br>
•	the Service Address (Rectification of Register) Regulations 2024 give the registrar similar rectification powers in relation to registered service addresses of a director, secretary, PSC or RLE to a default address; <br>
•	the Principal Office Address (Rectification of Register) Regulations 2024 give the registrar similar rectification powers in relation to the principal office address of a director, secretary, PSC or RLE to a default address; and <br>
•	the Limited Liability Partnerships (Application of Company Law) Regulations 2024 which provide for the application of certain reforms under ECCTA 2023 to LLPs.<br>
<br>
Companies House has also published updated guidance and forms to reflect the 4 March changes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Clients should monitor the government's implementation timetable and plan key actions accordingly. 
<br><br>
For example, UK incorporated companies will need ensure that all directors, PSCs (and Relevant Legal Entities) (and, where relevant, officers of such entities) and other persons filing on behalf of UK companies, LLPs and LPs have had their identity verified via one of the 2 methods for Identity Verification in order that each such individual obtains a unique identifier number to ensure it can continue to act in its appointed function.
<br><br>
Groups should also review their current corporate group structure to identify   whether has any UK corporate directors and, if so, take early steps to comply with the new verification requirements applying to natural persons acting as directors and/or any existing corporate directors.
<br><br>
Any new UK incorporated subsidiaries will need to comply with these measures as part of the incorporation process, which may add time and expense to set-up.
<br><br>
On an ongoing basis, UK incorporated companies should take due care when making filings in respect of its UK incorporated group companies (including, without limitation, whether any such companies will, upon the relevant parts of the Act becoming effective, the requirement to comply with the more rigorous financial reporting requirements that will be imposed on all micro entities and small and dormant companies).
<br><br>
UK incorporated companies will need to provide both a registered email address (to be supplied to Companies House and to which it can send communications) and a lawful purpose statement – when filing their next confirmation statement with a statement date from 5 March 2024. They will also need to ensure that at all times, their registered office is an ""appropriate registered office address"".
<br><br>
UK incorporated companies should discuss with their (group) accountants whether they are set-up to file using the new software-only filing system to be introduced by the Act (i.e., paper and Web filing will no longer be permitted).
<br><br>
If groups have any limited partnerships in their group structure, the filing and disclosure obligations will become more burdensome.</p>"
Withdrawal of the draft Companies Regulations 2023,Plan,Corporate Governance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>On 16 October 2023, the Department for Business and Trade announced that the government has withdrawn the draft Companies (Strategic Report and Directors' Report) (Amendment) Regulations 2023, in response to concerns raised by companies about the imposition of additional reporting requirements. These had been laid before parliament in July 2023.
<br><br>
They would have added certain additional corporate and company reporting requirements to large UK listed and private companies with ""a high level of employees and turnover"" (broadly companies with 750 or more employees and turnover of at least £750m). These would have included an annual resilience statement, distributable profits figure, material fraud statement and triennial audit and assurance policy statement.
<br><br>
In consultation, companies raised concerns about these additional reporting requirements which would have involved them incurring extra costs by requiring them to include additional corporate information in their annual reports.
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>The government will instead be proposing a new reform package that aims to deliver a more targeted, simpler and effective reporting framework for both business and investors.
<br><br>
In addition, the announcement also confirms that the government remains committed to the wider audit and governance reform, including establishing ARGA to replace the FRC and that legislation will be brought forward to deliver these reforms where Parliamentary time allows.</p>"
FRC publishes revised UK Corporate Governance Code,Prepare,Corporate Governance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>On 22 January 2024, the FRC announced the publication of revisions to the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. Alongside a revised version of the UKCG Code, the FRC has also published certain supporting materials. On 29 January 2024, the FRC published guidance to accompany the revised version of the Code – although not mandatory, it is intended to support those applying the updated Code and consolidates previously published guidance into a single document.
<br><br>
Following the withdrawal of the draft Companies (Strategic Report and Directors' Report) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 and the FRC's policy update in November 2023, certain amendments included in the consultation version of the Code have not been incorporated into the final version. One of the drivers for the FRC's decision to scale back the reform of the Corporate Governance Code is the concern from businesses about the introduction of yet more corporate reporting obligations.
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Key changes include the following:<br>
1. Governance reporting should focus on board decisions and their outcomes. New Principle C states that where the board reports on departures from the Code's provisions, it should provide a clear explanation.<br>
2. The requirement to assess and monitor how the company's desired culture has been embedded.<br>
3. Board appointments and succession planning should promote diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity. The list of diversity characteristics has been removed to reflect that diversity policies can be wide ranging.<br>
4. Monitoring and review of the company's risk management and internal control framework should cover all material controls, including financial, operational, reporting and compliance controls. Furthermore, the Code has been amended to include a requirement that the board should include in the annual report (i) a description of how the board has monitored and reviewed the effectiveness of the framework and (ii) a declaration of the effectiveness of the material controls as at the balance date sheet. There is also a requirement to include a description of any material controls which have not operated effectively as at the balance sheet date, the action taken, or proposed, to improve them and any action taken to address previously reported issues.<br>
5. Directors' contracts and/or any other agreements relate to director remuneration should include malus and clawback. In addition, a description of a company's malus and clawback provisions should be included in the annual report.</p>"
Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive,Action,Corporate Governance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Directive establishes a corporate due diligence duty.  It aims to foster responsible corporate behaviour and to anchor human rights and environmental considerations in companies’ operations and corporate governance. The new rules will ensure that businesses address adverse impacts of their actions, including in their value chains. Such impact will include slavery, child labour, labour exploitation, biodiversity loss, pollution or destruction of natural heritage.
<br><br>
Large EU companies and non-EU companies with significant EU activity will need to identify, prevent, mitigate, end and account for certain adverse human rights and environmental impacts. The recently adopted text makes several substantive changes to the original Commission proposal, including increasing the applicable thresholds for in scope companies, now set at over 1000 employees and a worldwide turnover above 450m euro.
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>If there is a likelihood of these thresholds being met, an early impact assessment of current internal policies would be advisable in order for the in-scope entity to assess whether any revisions would be necessary to internal policies and procedures to ensure that the in-scope entity can meet the standards imposed by the due diligence duty etc.</p>"
Diversity & Inclusion,Prepare,Corporate Governance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>On 25 September 2023, the FCA published a consultation paper on proposals to introduce a new regulatory framework on diversity and inclusion (D&I) in the financial sector. <br><br>
The FCA's framework would apply differently to firms depending on their number of employees, their categorisation under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR), and whether they are dual-regulated. To reduce regulatory burden, smaller firms with fewer than 251 employees would be exempt from many of the requirements. 
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Firms regulated by the FCA will be subject to new regulatory measures which aim to enhance D&I within their firms. The FCA plans to publish a Policy Statement in H2 2024 with an implementation date 12 months after the publication of the Policy Statement.</p>"
The Equality Act,Monitor,Corporate Governance,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Equality Act 2010 serves as a legal safeguard against discrimination in both the workplace and broader society. This Act consolidates previous anti-discrimination laws into one comprehensive piece of legislation, simplifying the legal framework while enhancing protection in certain scenarios. It outlines various forms of unlawful treatment towards individuals.<br>
Furthermore, the public sector Equality Duty, effective from 5 April 2011 across Great Britain, obligates public organisations to consider the impact of their actions on all individuals. This includes the development of policies, the provision of services, and employment practices. Public bodies are specifically mandated to focus on eliminating discrimination, promoting equal opportunities, and encouraging positive interactions among diverse groups during their operations.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Businesses should continue to monitor the Equality Act for new amendments. The latest is The Worker Protection (Amendment of Equality Act 2010) Act 2023 that will come into force in October 2024. Under the Act, employers will be under a new duty to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment of their employees in the course of their employment.</p>"
Capacity Market reform,Action,Energy,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>There was a consultation in January 2023 on a range of proposals to reform the Capacity Market. These are being taken forward in 2 phases. The Phase 1 proposals should be in place by the 2024 auctions and the Phase 2 proposals are subject to a further consultation, which opened on 16 October 2023 and closed on 8 December 2023.
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Clients should ensure they are familiar with the proposals. Phase 1 proposals include:
An extension to the temporary arrangements removing barriers to mothballed plant entering the Capacity Market (with a more enduring solution falling into phase 2).<br><br>
A temporary delay to the requirement for fossil fuel emissions declaration verification from prequalification 2023 to 2024 with any verification carried out in 2023 also being valid in 2024. This is to mitigate the risks of low numbers of accredited Independent Emissions Verifiers available for the 2023 prequalification window.<br><br>

The Phase 2 proposals are designed to improve security of supply and accelerate investment in low carbon technologies, including battery storage and demand side response. They include:<br>
Clarifying that a site cannot prequalify for the CM auction if they hold a CfD for a future delivery year<br>
Clarifying that battery augmentation is permitted so that storage CMUs can manage the natural decline in capacity due to degradation<br>
Setting out our plans to implement 9-year agreements and Capex thresholds for low carbon, new build and refurbishing capacity<br>
Building on the January 2023 consultation which asked for feedback on challenges faced by projects with long build times and potential supportive measures by proposing to offer a 24 month declared long stop date, in addition to the existing 12 month long stop date, for new build and refurbishing low carbon projects meeting the Capex thresholds of 15 and proposed 9-year agreements participating in T-4 auction<br>
Seeking evidence and views on creating new Generating Technology Classes to cover DSR<br>
Proposing that CM emissions are published on the CM register</p>"
Green Deal industrial plan,Plan,Energy,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>In February 2023, the European Commission published a Communication entitled ""A Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net-Zero Age"".
<br><br>
The plan enhances the competitiveness of Europe's net-zero industry and is accelerating the transition to climate neutrality. It does so by creating a more supportive environment for scaling up the EU's manufacturing capacity for the net-zero technologies and products required to meet Europe's ambitious climate targets.
<br><br>
It covers four key pillars<br><br>
●	Predictable and simplified regulatory environment<br>
●	Faster access to funding<br>
●	Enhancing skills<br>
●	Open trade for resilient supply chains<br>
<br><br>
Initiatives of the plan include:
<br><br>
The Net-Zero Industry Act which identifies goals for net-zero industrial capacity and provides a regulatory framework suited for its quick deployment.<br><br>

The Critical Raw Materials Act – ensuring sufficient access to materials.<br><br>

The reform of electricity market design – helping consumer benefit from the lower cost of renewables.<br><br>

The use of harmonised sustainability and circularity requirements in public procurement can help create a more predictable demand for net-zero products and solutions.<br><br>

The Commission will also facilitate the use of existing EU funds for financing clean tech innovation, manufacturing and deployment, with a focus on REPowerEU, InvestEU and the Innovation Fund. The Commission will also look to set up the European Sovereignty Fund.
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>To achieve these objectives, the availability of green technologies and products, such as photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, heat pumps, hydrogen electrolysers, batteries and carbon capture and storage equipment will need to be secured.
<br><br>
The Green Deal Industrial Plan will create an attractive environment for net-zero investments, so that the EU manufacturing capacity for these products is strengthened and demand satisfied.</p>"
2040 zero emissions airport target,Prepare,Energy,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Department for Transport has launched a consultation to help design a policy to enable the transition of airport operations in England to zero emission by 2040.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>The consultation forms the initial stages of the airport operations decarbonisation plans, seeking to formalise a definition of airport operations as well as to further understand the emissions sources that should be included within the target.
<br><br>
In particular, the consultation seeks to understand:<br>
o	to which entities the target should apply;<br>
o	the type and size of airport the target should be applied to;<br>
o	potential regulatory or voluntary approaches that could be used to implement the target;<br>
o	how the proposed target could be aligned with current schemes, such as the Airports Council International Airport Carbon Accreditation scheme;<br>
o	the barriers and opportunities which may exist in implementing the target, including commercial feasibility; and<br>
o	what the appropriate measuring and reporting processes should be<br><br>

The plan to ensure airport operations in England are operating at net zero by 2040 is part of the wider plan to ensure the aviation industry is operating at net zero by 2050.

The Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) ,Plan,Energy,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>This Order amends the target in the Climate Change Act 2008 from an 80% reduction in carbon emissions from 1990 levels, to a 100% reduction, by 2050, i.e. implementing the Committee on Climate Change's 'Net Zero' recommendation.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Any client that emits large amounts of carbon dioxide will be particularly affected, but all clients will have to seek to reduce their emissions if the UK is to hit this target. The impact is still being worked out.
</p>"
REPowerEU,Prepare,Energy,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>In response to disruption caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the European Commission is implementing its REPowerEU Plan. It is hoped REPowerEU will help the EU save energy, produce clean energy and diversify its energy supplies.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>There are now various initiatives to deliver the plan including:<br>
●	New national REPowerEU chapters under the updated Recovery and Resilience Facility<br>
●	Boosting industrial decarbonisation<br>
●	Sign-off and implementation of new legislation for faster renewables roll-out<br>
●	Investments in energy infrastructure and interconnections<br>
●	Regulatory measures to increase energy efficiency<br>
●	A modern regulatory framework for hydrogen, and a hydrogen accelerator<br>

Civil nuclear: roadmap to 2050,Plan,Energy,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The civil nuclear roadmap provides a pathway for the different nuclear technologies and sets out how the government expect UK nuclear deployment to happen, a timeline for the key decisions and actions, and clarity over the role government and industry should play in supporting and enabling this delivery
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Over the next 12 months, the Government commits to: consulting on Alternative Routes to Market for New Nuclear Projects and a new approach to siting nuclear within the National Policy Statement (NPS) (with a consultation on the draft NPS to follow), that will further inform civil nuclear policy; publishing a Nuclear Skills Taskforce report alongside a Defence Nuclear Enterprise Command Paper; and publishing a response to the consultation on nuclear decommissioning and managing radioactive substances, including radioactive waste.
</p>"
Decarbonising GB electricity network by 2035,Monitor,Energy,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The government has announced plans for GB to decarbonise the electricity network by 2035. The government said that its plans will reduce the UK's reliance on fossil fuels and exposure to volatile global wholesale energy prices and goes beyond what was committed in the December 2020 Energy White Paper.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Delivering this will require the deployment of a range of technologies, including onshore and offshore wind, hydrogen, solar PV, nuclear, and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). 
<br><br>
A net zero strategy was published on 19 October 2021, ahead of COP26.
</p>"
Infrastructure (Wales) Bill,Monitor,Energy,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Infrastructure (Wales) Bill establishes a new process, known as an ‘Infrastructure Consent’, for specific types of major infrastructure called ‘Significant Infrastructure Projects’ (SIPs).  <br><br>

The new Infrastructure (Wales) Bill, which was introduced to the Senedd in June 2023, will bring forth major changes to the legislative framework and will speed up the consenting process on both land and in the territorial sea. The new form of consent will be known as ‘Infrastructure Consent’ and will be issued in relation to Significant Infrastructure Projects, including energy, transport, waste and water, among other infrastructure types.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Two further consultations are expected in the Spring. The first consultation paper will focus on the pre-application consultation procedure and will be a call for evidence to stakeholders, local communities and other interested parties to seek ideas and suggestions for how pre-application consultation should be conducted. The second consultation paper will focus on fees for the consenting process.
</p>"
Connections reform proposals,Prepare,Energy,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>National Grid ESO has published initial proposals to further develop their long-term connections reforms which were originally announced in December 2023 to help speed up those in the queue for transmission connections. Under the reformed 'First Ready, First Connected approach' (otherwise known as 'TM04') projects will enter the connections process at ‘Gate 1’ but will need to reach certain criteria to arrive at ‘Gate 2’ at which point projects can obtain a queue position and a connection date. Prior to reaching Gate 2, projects would only receive an indicative connection date and connection point. <br><br>

ESO will seek to apply this First Ready, First Connected model retrospectively, across all projects in the connections queue. Projects in the existing queue will be given a period of time, prior to the implementation of these reforms, to demonstrate whether they have met Gate 2. Where projects meet the criteria, they will have the option to retain their existing connection date, or may request an accelerated connection date based on the reformed queue. 
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Monitor these developments as the reformed process could be in place by January 2025, subject to timelines for industry consultation and regulatory processes.

Hydrogen blending into GB gas distribution networks,Plan,Energy,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>Following a consultation,  the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has made a strategic policy decision to support blending of up to 20% hydrogen by volume into Great Britain’s gas distribution networks.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>The decision is subject to a satisfactory safety case for blending, so blending will not take place in the near future. When it does, its role will be as ""offtaker of last resort"" for hydrogen projects that would otherwise have no demand; and also as strategic enabler for electrolytic hydrogen projects in areas of surplus renewable electricity.
</p>"
Offshore Transmission Network Review,Prepare,Energy,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>This consultation sought views on a new enduring regime for windfarm development and offshore transmission.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>It will affect wind farms that are planned in the future (after 2030). There may be a strategic plan that sets out where they can be sited; and different delivery models. There is also information about multi purpose interconnectors (that connect wind farms to each other and to different markets).
</p>"
Human Rights Act,Plan,Environment & Sustainability,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Human Rights Act (HRA) came into force in October 2000, integrating specific rights and freedoms from the European Convention on Human Rights into UK legislation. The HRA has three primary impacts: it allows individuals to pursue justice within the UK courts instead of having to approach the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in France; it mandates that all public bodies in the UK uphold and protect an individual's human rights; and it requires that any new laws passed by the UK Parliament do not conflict with the rights outlined in the Convention.<br><br>
In a Real Estate context, the following provisions are especially pertinent:<br>
•	Article 8, which safeguards the right to respect for one's private and family life,<br>
•	Article 1 of the First Protocol (A1P1), concerning the protection of property, grants individuals the right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions (interpreted broadly),<br>
•	Article 6, which ensures the right to a fair trial. These rights are considered 'qualified rights', meaning they can be limited if such limitations are legally justified, legitimate, necessary, proportionate, and non-discriminatory.
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Clients should ensure they are familiar with the HRA and monitor discussions regarding any potential amendments e.g. the now scrapped Bill of Rights Bill.

Plan to reduce water pollution,Plan,Environment & Sustainability,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>Government plans announced will see:
<br>
A new legal duty on water companies in England to upgrade wastewater treatment works by 2030 in ‘nutrient neutrality’ areas to the highest achievable technological levels.
<br><br>
A new Nutrient Mitigation Scheme established by Natural England, helping wildlife and boosting access to nature by investing in projects like new and expanded wetlands and woodlands. This will allow local planning authorities to grant planning permission for new developments in areas with nutrient pollution issues, providing for the development of sustainable new homes and ensuring building can go ahead. Defra and DLUHC will provide funding to pump prime the scheme.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Clients should monitor these plans.

Electricity Generator Levy,Monitor,Environment & Sustainability,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Government announced an Electricity Generator Levy in the November 2022 Autumn Statement. The levy applies from 1 January 2023 until 31 March 2028 on ""extraordinary returns"" from selling electricity above £75/MW. For more detail see our Insight Electricity Generator Levy on Low Carbon Generators.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>The levy is a 45% tax on revenues from the sale of electricity at a price above £75/MW. It applies to companies or groups with a generation output of 50GWh per year or more. Legislation to bring it into effect will be part of the Finance Act this spring, but will be backdated to 1 January 2023. Siemens may well be affected and should be accounting for this. Note that it does not apply to projects that are paid under a Contract for Difference.

Clean Heat Market Mechanism consultation,Prepare,Environment & Sustainability,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>BEIS sought views in 2020 on options for the future support for low carbon heat, beyond the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI).
The consultation set out proposals for:<br><br>
- a Green Gas Support Scheme (GGSS): increasing the proportion of green gas in the grid through support for biomethane injection<br>
- a Clean Heat Grant: support for heat pumps and in certain circumstances biomass, through an upfront capital grant to help address the barrier of upfront cost<br>
- budget control and financial management of the spending proposals for green gas and buildings technologies <br>
- participant compliance<br><br>

A response to the Future Support for Low Carbon Heat & The Green Gas Levy consultation was published in March 2021.<br>
A response to the Clean Heat Grant proposals (now known as the Boiler Upgrade Scheme) was published on 19 October 2021.<br>
<br><br>
On 19 October 2021, BEIS published a further consultation: A market-based mechanism for low-carbon heat. This sought views on the introduction of a market-based mechanism to support investment and innovation in transforming the consumer proposition for heat pumps. The Energy Act 2023 contains provisions to implement a market-based mechanism for low-carbon heat (the Clean Heat Market Mechanism).<br><br>

As of March 2024, DESNZ is now inviting views on plans to adjust the date of introduction of the Clean Heat Market Mechanism scheme to 1 April 2025.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>This scheme will impact gas boiler manufacturers, who will have to match a certain percentage (increasing each year) of boiler sales with sales of heat pumps.

UK publishes transport adaptation strategy,Prepare,Environment & Sustainability,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Department for Transport has launched the transport adaptation strategy, which includes actions and policies designed to improve the UK transport system into one that is flexible, reliable, operates safely and is responsive to a changing climate. The first stage of the strategy is a consultation on the proposals, launched in April 2024.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>The transport adaptation strategy has three overarching objectives:<br><br>
o	helping the transport sector understand the need to adapt business and operations to the changing climate, building their response into ‘business as usual’;<br>
o	encouraging the transport sector to utilise available guidance and tools to support them in prioritising investments on adaptation and sharing information to galvanise adaptation action; and<br>
o	ensuring the Department for Transport (DfT) sets the strategic direction for the transport sector, enhancing adaptation action and fostering cross-sector collaboration.<br>

Biodiversity Net Gain,Prepare,Environment & Sustainability,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>From 12 February 2024, all planning permissions (subject to exceptions) granted in England pursuant to planning applications submitted under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 on or after this date are subject to a condition requiring that the biodiversity value attributable to the development exceeds the pre-development value of the onsite habitat by at least 10%.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>BNG is an approach to development that leaves the biodiversity of a site in a better state than before. While BNG is already a planning consideration, the new rules will mandate requirements to satisfy BNG as a planning condition. <br><br>
BNG requires all future development projects in England (subject to some exceptions) to deliver a minimum 10% BNG, to be maintained for a period of at least 30 years. BNG for small sites remains targeted to commence, from 2 April 2024, and implementation for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects remains targeted for 2025.

Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive,Action,Environment & Sustainability,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (""CSRD"") has been in force since 5 January 2023. 
<br><br>
The CSRD seeks to make businesses more publicly accountable by creating new rules requiring them to regularly disclose information on their societal and environmental impact. This is an attempt to address 'greenwashing' concerns and address shortcomings within existing legislation on the disclosure of non-financial information.
<br><br>
The CSRD requires in-scope companies to report on sustainability-related issues in line with the detailed set of disclosure standards developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (""EFRAG""). 
<br><br>
The CSRD extends to large and listed EU companies, as well as to large third country companies which do substantial business in the EU or have securities listed on EU regulated markets.
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>The CSRD will apply for large public-interest companies (PIEs) (with over 500 employees) that are already subject to Directive 2014/95/EU (the Non-Financial Reporting Directive). In practice, this will capture all listed companies plus large companies that exceed 2 of the 3 of the following:
• Balance sheet total: > EUR 20M<br>
• Net revenue: > EUR 40M<br>
• > 250 average number of employees during the FY<br><br>

It will also apply to non-EU companies (i.e. large UK corporate) with substantial activity in the EU will be in-scope for CSRD reporting. <br><br>

A third-party country legal entity will be in-scope if it meets the following criteria:<br><br>

1. Net turnover of EUR 150 million in the EU for each of the last two consecutive financial years; and<br>
2. At least one subsidiary or branch in the EU which:<br>
3. For a subsidiary: meets the criteria for categories (2) or (3) above; and<br>
4. For a branch: has a turnover of more than EUR 40 million<br>
<br>
The CSRD will require in-scope companies to disclose information on 'sustainability matters' that affect it (and its group), as well as the impacts on sustainability matters (the so-called 'double materiality' principle).  In particular, the CSRD will require management reports to include information on:
<br><br>
• the resilience of the company's business model and strategy to sustainability risks;<br>
• plans ensuring compatibility with the 1.5°C global warming target under the Paris Agreement regarding climate neutrality by 2050 and exposure to coal, oil and gas related activities.</p>"
Commercial Organisations and Public Authorities Duty (Human Rights and Environment) Bill,Prepare,Environment & Sustainability,,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>Presently a Bill requiring Parliamentary Consent, the Bill proposes the introduction of human rights and environmental due diligence across the value chain (being ""all activities undertaken b an entity during the lifecycle of a good or services upstream or downstream of the commercial organisaiton"")  on corporations in England and Wales. <br>
- obligation to prevent human rights and environmental harms ""so far as is reasonable practicable"" in their own operations and their value chains <br>
- obligates ""responsble disengagement""<br>
- applies even if the harm did not take place in the UK and the organisation was not located or regitered in the UK.<br>
- Collective responsbility of the board of directors, including criminal liability<br>
- the bill proposes civil and criminal liability for failure <br>
- up to 10% of global turnover in fines.<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Clients should seek to ensure that they have processess and systems in place that look to identify, prevent,  monitor and remedy any known human or environmental harms in their value chain and in their own operations. It would be advisable to align processes with expectations in the EU under CS3D and to be mindful of increate rights-based litigation trends that are forcing failures of due diligence to be brought before courts globally. </p>"
Heat and Buildings Strategy,Prepare,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Heat and Buildings Strategy was published on 19 October 2021.
<br>
Scotland has also published its vision for the future of heat in buildings, and the actions they are taking in the buildings sector to deliver climate change commitments.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>The Strategy sets out current and planned activities for the 2020s including aiming to phase out the installation of natural gas boilers from 2035 and whether to end gas connections to new homes built from 2025. This will lead to more electric heat pumps being installed.
</p>"
RAAC,Plan,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (RAAC) is present in many buildings constructed between the 1950s and mid-1990s (approximately) and has made headline news recently.<br><br>
Due to its construction, RAAC tends to be much weaker and more susceptible to degradation than traditional concrete, resulting in failure. The aerated structure means that moisture can easily penetrate and cause weakness, also causing steel reinforcements to rust and weaken. With an estimated life span of 30 years the last known RAAC produced in the UK is now beyond its design life expectancy, raising a number of health and safety concerns for buildings which contain it – most importantly, those buildings could be at risk of collapse with little or no notice.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Whilst the headlines relating to RAAC have largely focussed on public sector buildings, RAAC could be (and has been found to be) present in other types of buildings as well.<br><br>
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has advised owners or managers of estates to identify RAAC in their buildings and seek specialist advice to assess and manage such risks from its use.  <br><br>
Retail occupiers of affected premises need to be aware of the extent of their obligations under repair and service charge under their leases and to also consider the terms of their property and business interruption insurance.

EPCS/MEES,Plan,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>From 1 April 2023, it has been unlawful for a landlord to continue to let/sublet a commercial property with an EPC rating of ""F"" or ""G"". The minimum standard (an EPC rating of ""E"") needs to be met to continue letting properties under existing leases unless; the MEES Regulations don't apply; the landlord has carried out all cost-effective energy efficiency works, and the property remains sub-standard; or other registered exemptions under the MEES Regulations apply.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>These regulations apply in England and Wales only. The impact of this change will depend on a variety of factors e.g., the current EPC rating of commercial property assets and the relevant lease terms regarding MEES compliance/works.<br><br>

Clients with commercial property assets should assess their portfolio's EPC ratings and lease terms.
</p>"
Building Safety Act 2022,Action,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The BSA provides the basis for a new comparehensive regulatory regime in respect of structural and fire safety risks associated with specified buildings, with a key focus on accountability for building owners and giving a voice to tenants. A new regulator – the Building Safety Regulator (BSR) – has been established to oversee the new regulatory regime.<br><br>
The BSA introduced, amongst other requirements: (i) new dutyholder and competence requirements for all building works subject to the Building Regulations and (ii) additional requirements for ""higher risk buildings"" (HRBs), being buildings of at least 18 metres or 7 storeys in height and with at least two residential units, or a care home or hospital.<br><br>
The Act received Royal Assent on 28 April 2022 and has been brought into force in stages via secondary legislation. Many key provisions relating to the design and build phase of projects came into force on 1 October 2023 with a transitional period starting on that date and ending on 6 April 2024. Further regulations governing the occupational phase of projects came into force on 16 January 2024. The Act has an on-going impact.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>The BSA and the Regulations which implement it are far reaching and highly complex.  By way of high-level summary only, the main aspects of the new regime are as follows:<br><br>
Dutyholder and competence regime <br>
In place since 1 October 2023 for all new ""building work"" (i.e. any project which requires building regulations approval with very limited exceptions) and not just HRBs.  The new regime creates roles for specified dutyholders during construction projects (Principal Contractors and Principal Designers), sets out the duties that they must comply with, sets out the competence requirements for individuals and organisations who may hold those roles and identifies an additional layer of duties and roles that the dutyholders will have on any project involving HRB work.  Clients appointing Principal Contractors and Principal Designers must satisfy themselves as to the competence of those dutyholders. <br><br>
Design and construction phase requirements and oversight<br>
Under the new HRB regime, the BSR is entitled and empowered to inspect the progress of the works at agreed intervals, request that the works are opened up and issue compliance and stop notices.  There are new ""gateways"" where approval from the BSR is required (i.e. before building work is commenced and before the building is occupied), certain changes which need approval from the BSR and a requirement to create a digital store of key information that ensures that accurate building information is securely created, maintained and remains accessible throughout an HRB's lifetime (the ""golden thread"" of information).<br><br>
Occupational phase requirements<br>
The safety regime for HRBs in respect of occupation was brought into force via The Higher-Risk Buildings (Management of Safety Risk etc) (England) Regulations 2023 which came into force on 16 January 2024 and which introduce obligations relating to safety case reports, mandatory occurrence reports, prescribed information and numerous other matters.  Failure to meet a number of these requirements is a criminal offence.<br>
The Higher-Risk Buildings (Keeping and Provision of Information etc) (England) Regulations 2024 came into force on 16 January 2024 and specify the information and documents that the principal accountable person and accountable persons must keep and share as ""golden thread information"" with those who have an interest in relation to a HRB.<br><br>
New and extended remedies
The BSA introduced a number of new powers for the High Court and First Tier Tribunal (FTT) to make orders aimed at securing the remediation of building defects and contributing to the cost of that remediation:
•	Remediation Orders (section 123): the FTT may make an order requiring a ""relevant landlord"" to remedy a ""relevant defect"" (terms defined in the BSA) in a building that is at least 11 metres high or has at least 5 storeys and contains at least 2 separate dwellings.
•	Remediation Contribution Orders (section 124): the FTT may make orders to ensure that landlords, developers and ""associated"" persons contribute towards the cost of remediation work by someone else.
•	Building Liability Orders (section 130): the High Court may make a BLO to extend the specific liabilities of one body corporate to any of its ""associates"" and make them joint and severally liable (thereby piercing the corporate veil).
The BSA amends the Defective Premises Act 1972 (DPA), expanding the right to claim to cover any work done on an existing dwelling (in addition to new dwellings) and extending the limitation periods to 30 years retrospectively for claims arising before 28 June 2022 and to 15 years for claims arising after that date.
The BSA creates a new right to sue construction products' manufacturers and suppliers for damages.</p>"
Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 ,Monitor,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>There is a requirement for overseas entities to provide information to Registrar when in receipt of s1092A request for information – failure to do so will result in the OE not being a 'registered overseas entity' until remedied which can have significant consequences.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>ECCTA 2023 has amended the overseas entities provisions in para 8 of schedule 4A of Land Registration Act 2002 (LRA 2002) from 4 March 2024. The amendment means that where an overseas entity that has failed to provide information to the Registrar of Companies in accordance with a notice under s1092A CA 2006 (power of registrar to require information) it is not to be treated as being a 'registered overseas entity' until it remedies the failure. Failure is remedied when the documents are delivered, or the information is provided, to the registrar of companies. As failure to provide such information will mean an overseas entity ID will become void and the relevant overseas entity will not be able to buy, sell, transfer, lease or raise charges against property or land. <br><br>You should check the ROE entry at Companies House to see if any annotations have been added to that overseas entity's registration that suggest such a notice has been sent to the OE. It is expected that Companies House will put a note on the register if an OE has failed to respond to a s1092A notice by the date set out in that notice, however there has been no public statement to that effect.  There could also be an issue if the OE is non-compliant due to a failure to respond to a notice but Companies House has not yet added a note to the register to that effect.  We are still waiting for confirmation that Companies House will annotate the register in this way (we have heard talk that is the proposal) otherwise there appears to be no obvious way of checking whether a notice under section 1092A has been served or responded to by an OE other than obtaining additional information from the OE and its advisors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The ongoing requirements should be monitored and complied with as appropriate.<br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
If dealing with an OE, check that it has complied with its annual updating duty and not received any enquiries or communications from the Registrar of Companies relating to information in the ROE and the OE has not received a Section 1092A notice, or if it has, that it has complied with it to the satisfaction of the Registrar of Companies. </p>"

<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Better Building Partnership (BBP) has updated its Green lease toolkit - a collection of green lease provisions and guidance aimed at embedding green leasing and sustainable property management in leases  with versions for England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The last one was published over a decade ago in 2008 at a time when there was much less focus on sustainability. The new toolkit was launched on 29 January 2024.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>The toolkit delivers a framework to inspire collaboration between owners and occupiers to deliver sustainable outcomes for the real estate sector. While the toolkit has no regulatory status with no penalties for non-compliance, it is the most developed set of green lease drafting in the UK is likely to prove highly influential.<br><Br>
The Toolkit provides practical information to assist when drafting green leases, example drafting and other useful resources for encouraging sustainability in the property industry. 
<br><br>
The Toolkit, and the suggested drafting, is intended for use with commercial leases in a multi-let office building. The BBP intends to provide more sector-specific guidance in the future. The Toolkit includes:
 <br><br>
•	Suggested green lease drafting, with drafting notes.<br>
•	Guidance on owner and occupier engagement and what to consider at heads of terms stage.<br>

Ground Rent Consultation,Prepare,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Government is consulting on capping ground rents on existing residential leasehold properties in England and Wales.
The Ground Rent Act 2022 (in force) already limits ground rent on new long leases. The consultation seeks views on five potential options for retrospectively restricting ground rents in existing leases (being leases granted before 30 June 2022 or before 1 April 2023 for leases of retirement homes).
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Investors may lose a reliable source of long-term income from existing ground rents.  
If the Government goes ahead with its plans to amend existing ground rents without compensation, it calls into question to what extent investors can rely on freely negotiated contracts in the UK and has far reaching implications for UK plc.</p>"

<br>Businesses should monitor the Bill's developments.</p>"
Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024,Prepare,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>The Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act significantly enhances homeowners' rights, streamlining the process for leaseholders to purchase their freehold, extending standard lease terms to 990 years, and improving service charge transparency. It introduces measures to challenge unreasonable landlord charges, bans the sale of new leasehold houses except in special circumstances, ends excessive buildings insurance commissions, and abolishes the two-year ownership prerequisite for lease extensions or purchases. This legislation is poised to make property management and ownership more equitable and less burdensome for leaseholders.<br><Br>
For commercial real estate developers, a key point of interest is the adjustment in regulations regarding the management of mixed-use buildings. Previously, leaseholders were restricted from managing their property or acquiring its freehold if over 25% of the building's floor space was dedicated to commercial use. The Act raises this threshold to 50%, broadening opportunities for more homeowners to exercise the Right to Manage or pursue collective enfranchisement. This change is particularly relevant for developments with commercial elements, as it affects the balance of control between leaseholders and developers/managers in mixed-use properties.
<br><br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<br>Businesses must ensure they comply with the new measures and follow developments closely.</p>"
