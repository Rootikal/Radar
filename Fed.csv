The Building Safety Act 2022 (BSA) ,Monitor,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The BSA provides the basis for a new comprehensive regulatory regime in respect of structural and fire safety risks associated with specified buildings, with a key focus on accountability for building owners and giving a voice to tenants.  A new regulator – the Building Safety Regulator (BSR) – has been established to oversee the new regulatory regime. <br><br>
The BSA introduced, amongst other requirements: (i) new dutyholder and competence requirements for all building works subject to the Building Regulations and (ii) additional requirements for ""higher risk buildings"" (HRBs), being buildings of at least 18 metres or 7 storeys in height and with at least two residential units, or a care home or hospital.   
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
The ongoing requirements should be monitored and complied with as appropriate.
The 6 April 2024 is a pivotal date as it marks the end of the transitional period.  Clients procuring new building work which does not fall within the transitional arrangements will need to review their project arrangements and procurement processes to ensure they are suitable to enable compliance with the new, more onerous, regime for HRBs.

Renters (Reform) Bill,Action,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The Renters (Reform) Bill (England only) changes the law about rented homes. Its journey through Parliament had stalled, with rumours that the Bill would go no further, but Jacob Young MP confirmed to Conservative MPs in a leaked letter of 27 March that it would return to the Commons after Easter.  The Report Stage and Third Reading in the House of Commons is now set for Wednesday 24 April after which the amended Bill will go into the House of Lords for further scrutiny.
<br><br>
This is of relevance if investing in residential portfolios or mixed-use properties with a residential element. <br>
A Bill to make provision changing the law about rented homes, including abolishing fixed term assured tenancies and assured shorthold tenancies; imposing obligations on landlords and others in relation to rented homes and temporary and supported accommodation; and for connected purposes. Highlights include:
<br><br>
•	abolition of assured secure tenancies which will also end the use of section 21 ""no fault"" evictions ((although only when the courts are ready);
<br>
•	fixed term tenancies will be abolished, and all tenancies will be become periodic assured tenancies (except for Purpose-Built Student Accommodation – there is already criticism in the student market about the fact that only PBSA is excluded);
<br>
•	tenancies with a fixed term of more than 7 years will no longer be assured tenancies. No more risk of mandatory possession for rent arrears in shared ownership leases and leases with high ground rent;
<br>
•	the end of contractual rent increases – landlords will need to rely on using statutory rent increase mechanisms but NB a ""relevant low-cost tenancy"" (social/affordable rented) is excluded;
<br>
•	new notice periods and rights of possession for landlords, including possession for repeated cases of serious rent arrears, specific grounds for different types of accommodation (e.g., rent to buy, supported housing, temporary housing for homelessness).  There are lots of exclusions for social housing or where the landlord is an RP;
<br>
•	the creation of a new Property Ombudsman to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants;
<br>
•	the creation of The Private Rented Sector Database which will contain details of landlords; and
<br>
•	new civil and criminal penalties for breaches of some of the new rules.
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
Of relevance if investing in residential portfolios or mixed-use properties with a residential element. The big news is that the abolition of no-fault eviction (s21) will be delayed until a new court process and stronger other grounds for possession are in place. There is nothing yet in writing so it remains to be seen what the drafting will look like. There is still a discussion about how it will make the Decent Home Standard (which is also under review) binding in the PRS.
<br><br>
Jacob Young's letter suggested that amendments would be published to:<br>
•	create an initial six month period for tenants (although there will be exemptions)<br>
•	require the Lord Chancellor to publish an assessment on the readiness of the courts before abolishing section 21 <br>
•	undertake a review of local authority licensing schemes<br><br>
as well as review existing drafting on:<br>
•	ensuring the student market continues to work<br>
•	expanding homelessness prevention duties.

Consultation on improving transparency of land ownership involving trusts,Monitor,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The government launched a consultation on the transparency of land ownership when trusts are involved in the ownership structure. <br><br>
It sought views on how transparency about land held by trusts can be improved, as well as feedback on options to widen public access to trust information held on the register of overseas entities that hold UK land (ROE) that was launched on 1 August 2022. The consultation closed on 21 February 2024 and a response is awaited.
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
The current consultation seeks views on whether such ROE trust information should be publicly available by default (i.e. no application would be needed). <br><br>
The UK government currently has three main regimes in respect of economic transparency:<br><br>
•	the People with Significant Control (PSC) register – a public register on UK Companies House of the beneficial owners of UK companies and LLPs. <br>
•	the Trust Registration Service (TRS) – a requirement to file trust information with HMRC in relation to UK trusts and certain qualifying non-UK trusts. This information is not generally accessible by the public. <br>
•	the Register of Overseas Entities (ROE) – a public register on UK Companies House of the beneficial owners of overseas entities that are registered proprietors of UK land.  <br><br>
To date, the above regimes do not provide for public disclosure of beneficial ownership of trusts. The UK government considers this to be a notable gap in their ambition to create ownership transparency, particularly in respect of the ownership of UK land.

Leasehold and Freehold Reform Bill,Monitor,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The latest iteration of the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Bill was published at the end of February 2024 when the Bill was brought from the House of Commons into the Lords. The Bill went into Committee in the House of Lords on 22 April where we expect there to be close scrutiny of the provisions.<br><br>
This was introduced in the King's Speech in November 2023. It was subsequently introduced to Parliament on 27 November 2023. See Leasehold and Freehold Reform Bill.
It applies to England and Wales. Brief details below   taken directly from the Background Briefing Notes to the King's Speech. <br><br>                                                    
Empowering leaseholders<br><br>
•	increase the standard lease extension term from 90 years to 990 years for both houses and flats, with ground rent reduced to £0.<br>

•	remove the requirement for a new leaseholder to have owned their house or flat for two years before they can benefit from these changes.<br>

•	increase the 25% ‘non-residential’ limit preventing leaseholders in buildings with a mixture of homes and other uses such as shops and offices, from buying their freehold or taking over management of the buildings – to allow leaseholders in buildings with up to 50 per cent non- residential floorspace to buy their freehold or take over its management.<br><br>

Improving leaseholders' consumer rights<br><br>
•	make buying or selling a leasehold property quicker and easier by setting a maximum time and fee for the provision of information such as building insurance or financial records to a leaseholder by their landlord.<br>
•	require transparency over leaseholders’ service charges so the costs they are being charged by their freeholder or managing agent are in in a standardised comparable format.<br>
•	replace buildings insurance commissions for managing agents, landlords and freeholders with transparent administration fees. <br>
•	extend access to “redress” schemes for leaseholders to challenge poor practice. More freeholders will be required to belong to a redress scheme so leaseholders can challenge them if needed.<br>
•	scrap the presumption for leaseholders to pay their freeholders’ legal costs when challenging poor practice.<br>
•	grant freehold homeowners on private and mixed tenure estates the same rights of redress as leaseholders – by extending equivalent rights to transparency over their estate charges, access to support via redress schemes and to challenge the charges they pay by taking a case to a Tribunal, just like existing leaseholders.<br>
•	ensure freeholders and developers are unable to escape their liabilities to fund building remediation work – protecting leaseholders by extending the measures in the Building Safety Act 2022 to ensure it operates as intended.<br><br>

Reforming the leasehold market<br><br>
•	ban the creation of new leasehold houses so that - other than in exceptional circumstances - every new house in England and Wales will be freehold from the outset.<br>
•	consult on capping existing ground rents, to ensure that all leaseholders are protected from making payments that require no service or benefit in return, have no requirement to be reasonable, and can cause issues when people want to sell their properties. Subject to that consultation, the government will look to introduce a cap through this Bill.<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
An article in the Sunday Times on 21 April suggested that Michael Gove has had to ""water down"" his ground rent reforms.  We are waiting for an official DLUHC announcement (and detailed drafting for the Bill) but it is expected that the current ground rent rules will be phased out over the next twenty years, with ground rents payable in those twenty years being capped to £250 per year.

Levelling up and Regeneration Act 2022 (LURA) ,Prepare,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
There has been much publicity surrounding the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023 (LURA) which the government hopes will help reverse geographical disparities between different parts of the UK. It introduces some wide-ranging reforms to the planning system and potentially wide powers that will require the disclosure of information about those who control land for land transactions in England and Wales, in addition to compulsory high street rental auctions.<br><br>
High Street Rental Auctions<br><br>

Part 10 LURA gives new powers to local authorities to force landlords to let empty premises in town centres and on high streets in England and Wales by instigating compulsory rent auctions. Please see AG article here for further details on the auction process.<br><br>
Disclosure of land interests<br><br>
Part 11 LURA will require the disclosure of information about those who control land for land transactions in England and Wales. Its impact is not immediate.<br><br>
The detail of the new information requirements will be set out in regulations which will stipulate who must provide information, in what circumstances, in what time frame and to whom (it must be either the Chief Land Registrar or another person exercising public functions on behalf of the Crown) and to what extent it will be made public. <br><br>
The required information may include the transaction parties and details, along with the source of any money paid/consideration given for the transaction with copies of any transaction documents. <br><br>
Planning <br><br>

LURA introduces some wide-ranging reforms to the planning system including changes to the National Planning Policy Framework which should be published soon. The Autumn 2023 Statement included proposals to introduce new “premium planning services” across England with “guaranteed accelerated decision dates"" for major applications and fee refunds wherever these are not met. We wait to see further detail and how this will interact with LURA reforms.<br><br>
Ultimately, there will be changes to the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) with the introduction of the new Infrastructure Levy (IL) in England (but not just yet).
Enforcement <br><br>
Section 115 LURA amends the time limits for planning enforcement action in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.  The amendment applies to England but not Wales.
 <br><br>
Sections 115 extends the planning enforcement time limit in England to ten years for (a) building operations and (b) change of use to a single dwellinghouse, in place of the previous four-year limit.  Other breaches already have a ten-year time limit. 
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
This is simply a ""watch this space"" for the moment for further developments and timescales for implementation.<br><br>
The Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023 (Commencement No 3 and Transitional Savings Provision ) Regulations 2024 will bring section 203 (Rental auctions), section 205 (Terms of contract for tenancy), section 206 (Terms of tenancy) and section 214 (Further provision about letting notices) into force from 31 March 2024. Section 215 (Other formalities), which allows for regulations to be made on various aspects of the high street rental auction process, is also being brought into force on 31 March 2024.
In essence, all this means is that further regulations will be issued at some point, so despite coming into force on 31 March 2024, we know nothing more at this stage.<br><br>
Changes to planning enforcement rules<br><br>
The changes which apply to England only are not yet in force but will need to be considered on any due diligence.<br><br>
The new 10-year time limit for building operations also applies to change of use to a single dwelling house. Accordingly, where there is not a planning permission in place, it will become important to check that the development was carried out at least ten years ago. There is no time limit for enforcement in the case of listed buildings.

Ground Rent Consultation,Prepare,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
Capping existing ground rents <br><br>
There is a Government consultation :“Modern leasehold: restricting ground rent for existing leases” on capping ground rents on existing residential leasehold properties in England and Wales.<br><br>

The Ground Rent Act 2022 (in force) already limits ground rent on new long leases of houses and flats (with certain exceptions) to one peppercorn per year.<br><br>

The consultation seeks views on five potential options, (see below), for retrospectively restricting ground rents in existing leases (being leases granted before 30 June 2022 or before 1 April 2023 for leases of retirement homes).<br><br>

The Government has noted that subject to this consultation, they will look to introduce a cap on existing ground rents through the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Bill. However, rumour has it that Michael Gove may no longer reduce existing ground rents to zero.<br><br>

The consultation puts forward five options:<br><br>

•	Capping ground rents at a peppercorn – the Government particularly encourages stakeholders to share any evidence of the likelihood of freeholders leaving the market if a peppercorn cap is introduced, and if it were to happen, the potential impacts on freeholders, leaseholders, investors, and the wider market.<br>
•	Setting a maximum financial value for ground rent.<br>
•	Capping ground rents at a percentage of the property value.<br>
•	Limiting the ground rent to the original value when the lease was agreed.<br>
•	Freezing the ground rent at current levels.<br><br>
It makes it clear that the starting point is that there will be no compensation paid to investors.
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
Whilst leaseholders may save annual ground rent payments, if freeholders were to become insolvent as a result of ground rents being abolished or capped, there will be no safety net from freeholders in respect of liabilities such as remediation costs under the Building Safety Act 2022.  If any of the 5 options set out in the consultation were implemented, it calls into question to what extent investors can rely on freely negotiated contracts in the UK and has far reaching implications for UK PLCs. One to watch and to await the outcome of the consultation. It remains to be seen whether there will be a ban on zero ground rents in existing leases.

Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 ,Prepare,Real Estate,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The Law Commission of England & Wales has announced that it will review this key piece of legislation which has not been updated since 1994, with the aim of developing a framework that is widely used, rather than opted out of. The Act provides business tenants with the right to remain in their rented premises after contractual lease expiry.
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
This is simply a ""watch this space"" for the moment. The Law Commission was hoping to publish a consultation paper by the end of December 2023. The launch has been delayed until early 2024 and it is now expected in Autumn 2024.

<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
BNG is an approach to development that leaves the biodiversity of a site in a better state than before. While BNG is already a planning consideration, the new rules will mandate requirements to satisfy BNG as a planning condition. <br><br>
BNG requires all future development projects in England (subject to some exceptions) to deliver a minimum 10% BNG, to be maintained for a period of at least 30 years.

The new toolkit was launched on 29 January 2024. The last one was published over a decade ago in 2008 at a time when there was much less focus on sustainability.
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
The toolkit delivers a framework to inspire collaboration between owners and occupiers to deliver sustainable outcomes for the real estate sector. While the toolkit has no regulatory status with no penalties for non-compliance, it is the most developed set of green lease drafting in the UK is likely to prove highly influential.<br><br>
The Toolkit provides practical information to assist when drafting green leases, example drafting and other useful resources for encouraging sustainability in the property industry.

The Toolkit, and the suggested drafting, is intended for use with commercial leases in a multi-let office building. The BBP intends to provide more sector-specific guidance in the future. The Toolkit includes:
 <br>
•	Suggested green lease drafting, with drafting notes. <br>
•	Guidance on owner and occupier engagement and what to consider at heads of terms stage. <br>
•	Example case studies.  <br> <br>

"Contractual controls on land: consultation

<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The Government published a Contractual controls on land consultation,(which applies to England and Wales) seeking views on its plans, through Part 11 of the Levelling Up and Regeneration Act 2023 (LURA 2003), to provide greater transparency on ‘contractual control agreements’ in England and Wales.<br><br>
The aim is to increase transparency around ""contractual arrangements used to exercise control over the buying and selling of land "" by creating a public register of interests such as options, rights of pre-emption and estate contracts. The proposed public (and free) data set will comprise the ""what"", ""where"", ""who"" and ""when"" of contractual land agreements with some exemptions (such as overage and clawback agreements, agreements made for the purposes of national security or defence and finance agreements)
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
This is simply a ""watch this space"" for the moment. Whether there is sufficient public interest at present to justify collating and publishing the data is questionable. In addition, the Government proposes to not only collect data on existing agreements entered into from 6 April 2021, but also to collect data on extant agreements entered into at any time, if they are varied in such a way that alters any of the required information or are assigned from the commencement date of the regulations (expected 6 April 2026). <br><br>
There will be criminal penalties for non -compliance (including unlimited fines and up to two years imprisonment) and HMLR will refuse to register a notice or restriction to protect an agreement unless information regarding control agreements is provided. The BPF will submit a response.

The Non-Domestic Rating (Unoccupied Property) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2024, amend the Non-Domestic Rating (Unoccupied Property) (England) Regulations 2008, to extend the period during which a property can be occupied, but still be considered to be unoccupied for the purposes of empty rates relief, from six to thirteen weeks. The regulations come into force on 1 April 2024.
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>

Overseas enforcement of judgments: UK signs the Hague Convention 2019,Plan,Disputes,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The UK has signed the Hague Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters 2019 (Hague Convention 2019), to facilitate better international recognition and enforcement of civil and commercial English judgments. <br><br>
Enforcement of a relevant judgment given in the courts of one contracting state can only be refused by the courts of another contracting state on limited grounds, such as fraud or public policy. <br><br>
The Convention deals with the recognition and enforcement of judgments, not the allocation of jurisdiction between contracting states' courts.<br><br> 
The Convention applies to judgments given pursuant to non-exclusive and asymmetric jurisdiction clauses.  It does not apply to judgments given pursuant to exclusive jurisdiction clauses, which will continue to be covered by the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005. The Hague Convention 2019 will come into force for the UK 12 months after ratification and will apply to judgments in proceedings started after that date.  <br><br>
The UK government expects ratification to take place during 2024.
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
Parties to contracts will feel more comfortable including a non-exclusive or asymmetric jurisdiction clause in their agreements, knowing that a judgment of the English court given pursuant to such a clause should be recognised and enforced in the courts of signatories to the Hague Convention 2019.<br><br>
Signatories include EU member states other than Denmark.

Litigation funding: – legislation tabled to reverse PACCAR,Plan,Disputes,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The effect of the Supreme Court's decision in R (on the application of PACCAR Inc and others) v Competition Appeal Tribunal and others [2023] UKSC 28 was that litigation funding agreements under which the funder stood to receive a percentage of the damages recovered were not enforceable unless they complied with legislation regulating damages-based agreements (which most do not).<br><br>
The UK government has tabled legislation to reverse that effect. The Litigation Funding Agreements (Enforceability) Bill is intended to reverse PACCAR so that litigation funding agreements within the definition introduced by the Bill are excluded from the definition of damages-based agreements.  It will have retrospective effect. The Bill had its second reading in the House of Lords on 15 April 2024, and the committee stage is expected to start on 29 April 2024.
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
Litigation funding agreements which provided for some remuneration to the funders by reference to the amount of damages recovered needed, in some cases, to be renegotiated to remain enforceable as the parties intended post-PACCAR.
The new legislation would have the effect of reinstating the status quo.

Compulsory mediation,Prepare,Disputes,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
There are two recent developments.<br>
•	Mediation will soon be compulsory for most claims under £10,000.
•	A consultation has been opened by the Civil Procedure Rules Committee to look at what rule changes should flow from the Court of Appeal's decision in James Churchill -v- Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council [2023] EWCA Civ 1416.  (In that case the Court of Appeal found the court could stay proceedings for, or order parties to engage in, non-court-based dispute resolution process such as mediation.)

<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
Federated Hermes should remain alive to the risk of not considering or refusing an offer to engage in a form of alternative dispute resolution, whatever the claim value.

Non-party access to court documents: possible changes,Monitor,Disputes,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
A consultation about proposed changes to the court rules on how and when non-parties can access court documents closed in April 2024.  
<br><br>
The proposed changes could mean that non-parties would be able to access witness statements, expert reports and skeleton arguments much earlier than is currently the case.
<br><br>
A number of lawyers and other professional bodies have expressed concern about the extent of the changes, and it is hoped the Civil Procedure Rules Committee will reconsider the changes required to give effect to a Supreme Court decision, Cape Intermediate Holdings Ltd v Dring (for and on behalf of Asbestos Victims Support Groups Forum UK) [2019] UKSC 38, which was the starting point for these changes. Any changes are likely to come into force in October 2024.
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b><br>
The proposed changes which were the subject of the consultation contained no grandfathering provisions, with the consequence that – to the extent they remain on the court file – witness statements and expert reports filed prior to the introduction of the new rules could become available to non-parties.
<br><br>
Subject to the final form of the new rules, Federated Hermes should therefore consider whether there are any cases for which it should ask the court to restrict the court file.
