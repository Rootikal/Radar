The Employment Rights Regulations 2023,Action,Employment,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The Employment Rights (Amendment, Revocation and Transitional Provision) 
Regulations 2023 came into force on 1 January 2024 and amend the Working Time Regulations and TUPE, following consultations earlier in 2023. 
<p>
<br>
â€¢ Time record keeping: 
<p>
The Regulations simplify record-keeping requirements under WTR to provide that employers do not have to keep a record of the daily working hours of all workers, if they are able to demonstrate compliance without doing so. 
<p>
<br>
â€¢ Single annual leave entitlement: 
<p>
They maintain two distinct pots of annual leave and two existing rates of holiday pay, so that workers continue to receive 4 weeks at normal rate of pay and 1.6 weeks at basic rate of pay.  They also define normal remuneration to retain the two rates of pay, so that a week's pay for the purposes of holiday pay for the 4 weeks at the normal pay rate includes, among other things, commission and regular overtime. 
<p>
<br>
â€¢ Irregular-hours/part-year workers: 
<p>
They permit rolled-up holiday pay for irregular-hours and part-year workers only. The Government will legislate to ensure that all employers that choose to use rolled-up holiday pay calculate it based on a worker's total earnings in a pay period. 
They provide a method for calculating holiday accrual for irregular-hours and part-year workers, which may include some agency workers, based on 12.07% of hours worked in a pay period both in the first year of employment and beyond. Other workers continue to accrue leave at 1/12th of their entitlement on the first day of each month during their first year of employment. 
They define irregular-hours and part-year workers and introduce a 52-week reference period for accrued annual leave, when irregular-hours and part-year workers go on maternity/family related leave or sick leave, allowing employers to look back and work out an average of hours worked across that period. 
<p>
<br>
â€¢ Preserving rights derived from EU case law: 
<p>
They preserve workers' existing rights derived from EU case law to carry over untaken holiday into the following leave year in certain situations, including, among other things, inability to take holiday due to sickness, maternity/family related leave or where misclassified or dissuaded from taking it. 
<p>
<br>
â€¢ Repealing COVID-19 holiday rules: 
<p>
They repeal the COVID-19 holiday carry-over rules, with a short transitional period to enable any accrued leave to be used up. 
<p>
<br>
â€¢ TUPE Reforms: 
<p>
They amend TUPE to allow small businesses (less than 50 employees) that propose a transfer of any size, along with businesses of any size that propose to transfer fewer than 10 employees, to consult directly with their employees if there are no existing worker representatives in place.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
M&S will need to analyse who will be caught by the new definition of irregular hours and part year workers.  The changes to irregular hours and part year workers will apply in the holiday year beginning on or after 1 April 2024.
<p>
<br>
If M&S wants to use rolled up holiday pay for its irregular hours and part year workers it will need to change their contracts.
<p>
<br>
M&S will also need to decide how to handle requests from irregular hours and part year workers to take more holiday than has been accrued at any given point in the year, as well as how these workers will be able to take their holiday that only accrues on the last day of the 12th period of the holiday year.
<p>
<br>
M&S will need to review contracts, policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the new rules, in particular, the capturing of overtime, commission and allowance payments in at least 4 weeks of holiday pay.
<p>
<br>
Employers will also need to take proactive steps to remind workers to use their holiday entitlement and ensure they have sufficient opportunity to take it.
</p>"
Workers Act 2023,Prepare,Employment,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The Workers (Predictable Terms and Conditions) Act 2023 will give workers and agency workers the right to request a predictable work pattern where there is a lack of predictability as regards any part of their work pattern, the change relates to their work pattern and where the purpose in applying for the change is to get a more predictable work pattern. Fixed term contracts of 12 months or less are presumed to lack predictability. 
<BR><BR>
The Act allows for two applications in a twelve-month period with a minimum service requirement (expected to be 26 weeks) to access the right. Employers can reject applications on statutory grounds and workers will have the right not to suffer a detriment short of dismissal for making an application/automatic unfair dismissal right. 
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<BR>
Starbucks will need to assess the impact the new legislation will have on its business, as it could mean changes to the way work patterns are managed.  
</p>"
Employment Relations Act 2023,Prepare,Employment,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
The Employment Relations (Flexible Working) Act 2023 will introduce changes to the right to request flexible working, including a new requirement that employers cannot refuse an application unless they have first consulted the employee about the application.  It allows for two statutory requests in any 12-month period (currently one), employers will be required to respond to a request within two months (currently three) and employees will no longer be required to explain what effect, if any, the change applied for will have on the employer and how the effect might be dealt with.  

Regulations will make flexible working requests a day one right, removing the current 26-week qualifying period and will come into force on 6 April 2024. There is currently no commencement date for the other provisions, but ACAS has indicated that it expects the additional reforms to come into force at the same time as the day one right to request flexible working on 6 April 2024.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
M&S needs to be aware of the new measures coming through, in particular, the removal of the 26-week qualifying period for making flexible working requests from 6 April 2024.
<br>
It will also need to update policies and train appropriate staff on the other changes before April 2024
</p>"
New National Living and Minimum wage,Plan,Employment,FALSE,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
From 1 April 2024 the National Living Wage (NLW) will apply to all workers aged 21 and over and will rise from Â£10.42 to Â£11.44 per hour. 
<br>
National Minimum Wage (NMW) rates will also rise: 
<p>
â€¢ from Â£7.49 to Â£8.60 for those aged 18-20, 
<p>
â€¢ from Â£5.28 to Â£6.40 for those aged 16-17; and 
<p>
â€¢ from Â£5.28 to Â£6.40 for Apprentices. 
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
The almost 10% increase in the NLW up to Â£11.44/hour will apply to 21-year-olds for the first time and will mean that the minimum salary of a worker working 40 hours per week will be near Â£24,000. 
<p>
<br>
M&S will face higher wages bills, most likely including the knock-on effect of higher wages for more senior employees to maintain an appropriate pay differential. The increase will also bring more workers closer to the NLW / NMW limits. 
<p>
<br>
M&S will need to be alive to the common risk areas that create NLW / NMW underpayment, especially within the context of different job roles or sections of the workforce that were not perhaps previously in scope of the NLW / NMW legislation.
</p>"
Paternity leave reforms,Monitor,Employment,FALSE,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The Government has set out changes to paternity leave to be implemented.  Eligible fathers and partners will be able to take paid paternity leave in two separate blocks of one week each if they wish rather than having to take all their leave in one go at any time within the first 52 weeks of birth (or placement for adoption) rather than in the first 8 weeks of birth (or placement for adoption). 
<BR><BR>
Fathers and partners will need to give their notice of entitlement to paternity leave and pay 15 weeks before the birth, but for notice of the paternity leave start date they will only need to give 28 days' notice before the date that they intend to take each period of leave (and pay, where they qualify). 
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<BR>
Starbucks will need to update policies on paternity leave when the proposals are implemented.
</p>"
Duty to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace,Plan,Employment,,"<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
<p>
Under the Worker Protection (Amendment of Equality Act 2010) Act 2023, employers will be under a new mandatory duty to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment of their employees in the course of their employment. Breach of this duty may be enforced by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) under its existing enforcement powers and, where a claim for sexual harassment has been upheld, by an employment tribunal.
<p>
<br>
 The tribunal may order an uplift of up to 25% of any compensation awarded for sexual harassment if the tribunal considers that the duty to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment has been breached.
</p>
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<p>
M&S will be required to take reasonable steps to prevent sexual harassment and should train line managers on the new duty before October 2024.
</p>"
Protection from Redundancy Act 2023,Prepare,Employment,,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The Protection from Redundancy (Pregnancy and Family Leave) Act 2023 is expected to come into force on 6 April 2024 and provides that expectant mothers and new parents will receive greater protection from redundancy during pregnancy and new parents will have extended protections when they return from maternity, adoption and shared parental leave.  Draft Regulations provide protection against redundancy: 
<BR><BR>
• during pregnancy, from the date when the employee tells their employer about their pregnancy and ends on the day maternity leave starts (or two weeks after the end of pregnancy where no statutory maternity leave entitlement),  and
<BR><BR>
• during and after maternity leave or adoption leave (or those taking six or more consecutive weeks of shared parental leave who have not taken maternity/adoption leave), ending 18 months after the expected week of childbirth or date they enter GB. 
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<BR>
The new enhanced right will extend the period of protection from redundancy so that it will now cover the period from when the employer is told of the pregnancy up to eighteen months after the birth.  
<BR><BR>
Starbucks will need to consider the extended statutory protection for pregnant women and new parents in any redundancy exercise for any employees who notify of their pregnancy on or after 6 April 2024 and for any maternity/adoption leave ending on or after 6 April 2024 and to a period of six consecutive weeks' shared parental leave starting on or after 6 April 2024.
</p>"
"Statutory Code on ""Fire and Rehire""",Monitor,Employment,,"<p>
<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br>
The Government published a draft Code of Practice on the use of dismissal and re-engagement practices to bring about changes to employees' terms and conditions of employment along with a consultation inviting views on the draft Code in January 2023.  The draft Code sets out a step-by-step process that an employer should follow to explore alternatives to dismissal and to engage in meaningful consultation with trade unions, employee representatives or with affected employees to find an agreed solution.  Tribunals and courts will be required to take into account the statutory code when considering relevant cases with the power to uplift an employee's compensation by 25% where the code applies and the employer has unreasonably failed to follow it. 
<br>
<b>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</b>
<BR>
Starbucks will need to comply with the new statutory code of practice when it comes into force.
